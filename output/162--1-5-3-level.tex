\subsection{Euler's totient function}
Two positive integers whose greatest common divisor equals $1$ are called relatively prime.
Denote by $\phi(n)$ the number of positive integers $\le n$ which are relatively prime to $n$:
\[
\phi(n) = \#\{k \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \mid \gcd(k,n) = 1\}.
\]
For example, for $n = 6$ only the numbers $1$ and $5$ among $1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$ are relatively prime to $6$,
so that we have $\phi(6) = 2$.
In $n=p$ is prime, then all numbers $1, \ldots, p-1$ are relatively prime to $p$, so that $\phi(p) = p-1$.
