Let us design a machine accepting the language .
The algorithm is as follows:
check the first zero, move right until meet the first one and check it, move left to the first unchecked one and check it, move right... etc.
The machine will have several states according to the tasks: for example, a state for moving right until find the first (unchecked) one.
Checking the symbols will be done by replacing them:  with , and  with .
By carefully working out the details one may arrive at a machine with

Q = q_0, q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4, = 0, 1, X, Y, B, F = q_4

and the move function described by the following table.
