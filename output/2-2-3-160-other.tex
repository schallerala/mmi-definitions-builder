\begin{proof}
Let the components have $n_1, \ldots, n_k$ vertices.
By the above theorem, they have $n_1 - 1, \ldots, n_k - 1$ edges, respectively.
By summing up the number of edges we obtain the desired result.
\end{proof}

% Also, Theorem \ref{thm:TreeEdges} implies yet another characterization of trees.
