To summarize, we have found that the number of elements in each of the
following sets is $2^n$:

-   Maps from an $n$-element set to $\{0,1\}$.

-   Subsets of an $n$-element set.

-   Outcomes in tossing a coin $n$ times.

-   Binary sequences of length $n$.

Between any two of these sets there is a natural bijection. Some of
these bijections were described above.
