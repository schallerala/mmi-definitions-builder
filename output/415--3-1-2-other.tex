Speaking more formally, any valuation $v$ extends to a unique map
\[
\hat{v} \colon \Prop \to \{0,1\}
\]
defined recursively by $\hat{v}(x) = v(x)$ for all $x \in S$ and by
\begin{align*}
\hat{v}(A \wedge B) &= \hat{v}(A) \wedge \hat{v}(B) & \hat{v}(A \vee B) &= \hat{v}(A) \vee \hat{v}(B)\\
\hat{v}(A \to B) &= \hat{v}(A) \to \hat{v}(B) & \hat{v}(\neg A) &= \neg \hat{v}(A),
\end{align*}
where the values at the right hand sides are computed according to the truth tables of logical connectives.

Although by definition every valuation $v$ assigns truth values to \emph{all} proposition symbols,
in order to determine $\hat{v}(A)$ we need to know only the values of symbols occuring in $A$.
