Boolean functions
Although the set of all proposition symbols is infinite,
every proposition contains only a finite number of distinct proposition symbols.
Assume that  contains only symbols from the set .
Then  defines a map

f_A 0,1^n 0,1

in the following way.
Every element  can be viewed as a partial valuation, giving  the truth value  for .
Then  is the truth value of  corresponding to this valuation:

f_A(x_1, , x_n) = v(A),  where  v(p_i) = x_i.


The function  is described by the truth table of proposition .
As an immediate reformulation of Definition dfn:LogEqProp,

A B f_A = f_B.


In fact, --valued functions of --valued agruments is a very basic object which can be studied irrespective of the propositional logic.
