A map is bijective iff at every element of  ends exactly one arrow.
By inverting the arrows we obtain the inverse map ,
which has the properties  for all  and  for all .

If  is not bijective, then there is no inverse map .
However, by abuse of notation one uses  to denote the preimage of :

f^-1(y) = x X f(x) = y.

Similarly one can define the preimage  of any subset .

Observe that

We can now formulate the quotient rule in the mathematical language.

A special case of this is the bijection principle:
