Euler's formula
A plane graph separates the plane into regions, called faces.
Every embedding has one unbounded face, called the outer face.

The graphs on Figure fig:TwoEmbeddings have two faces each.
If the graph has  vertices and no edges, then its embedding has only one face: the plane punctured at  points.

A face is called incident with an edge if the edge belongs to the boundary of the face.
