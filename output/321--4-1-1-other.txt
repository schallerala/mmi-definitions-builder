Formulas obtained by applying the first or the second rule are called atomic formulas (because they cannot be decomposed into smaller formulas).

For example, in the signature
align*
: &a(), f() 

: &P(, )
align*
one can build the following formulas:
gather*
x (f(x) = a)

x (f(x)=f(y) x=y)

x P(x, f(x)).
gather*
