The coefficients in the above formula come from the -th row of the Pascal triangle.
For example, by looking at the Pascal triangle we can conclude

(a+b)^5 = a^5 + 5a^4b + 10a^3b^2 + 10a^2b^3 + 5ab^4 + b^5.


proof
How do we prove ?
For this, we write , multiply
every term inside the first pair of brackets with every term inside the second pair of brackets,
and finally collect the like terms:

(a+b)^2 = (a+b)(a+b) = a^2 + ab + ba + b^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2.

What happens when we multiply out  pairs of brackets ?

(a+b)^n = (a+b)(a+b) (a+b)_n  pairs of brackets

Before collecting the like terms, we obtain a sum of products of  factors,
every factor being  or .
That is to say, we are writing down all words of length  consisting of letters  and .
When collecting the like terms, we ignore the order of letters in each word, counting only
the number of 's and 's.
That is to say, the term  occurs in our sum as often as
there are -words of length  with  letters  and  letters .
But we know that there are  such words, and the theorem follows.
proof

Instead of  and  we can substitute any numbers or expressions.
For example, we have

(1+x)^n = _k=0^n nk x^k.

Note that by substituting  we obtain a new (but a quite intricate) proof of Theorem thm:BinomSum.
