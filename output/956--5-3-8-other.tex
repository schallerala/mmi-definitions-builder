\begin{proof}
Recall that
\[
(1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3) \cdots = 1 + \sum_{n=1}^\infty q_n x^n,
\]
because the general term of the brackets expansion on the left hand side is $x^{k_1 + \cdots + k_m}$, where all $k_i$ are different.
Now, when we expand the product $(1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3)\cdots$, the general term has the form $(-1)^m x^{k_1 + \cdots + k_m}$.
Therefore the coefficient at $x^n$ is the number of partitions into an even number of distinct parts
minus the number of partitions into an odd number of distinct parts.
\end{proof}

We have reduced Theorem \ref{thm:EulerPenta} to the following lemma.
