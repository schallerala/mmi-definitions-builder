proof
This is similar to the money changing problem, but with banknotes of any denomination available.

The right hand side is equal to

(1+x+x^2+)(1+x^2+x^4+)(1+x^3+x^6+)= x^m_1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 + + km_k,

where the sum is taken over all  and all collections of non-negative integers .
When we collect the like terms, the coefficient at  will be equal to the number of representations of  in the form
.
This corresponds to a unique partition, namely to

n = k++k_m_k + + 1++1_m_1.

Thus the product on the right hand side is equal to the generating function of the number of partitions.
proof

In the above proof we met an infinite product of power series.
This product is again a power series because in order to compute the coefficient at 
only finitely many factors from the infinite product are needed (the first  factors in the above case).
Definitions below formalize this.
