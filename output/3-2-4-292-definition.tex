\begin{dfn}
A \emph{sequent} is a pair $(\Gamma, \Delta)$ of finite (possibly empty) sets of propositions.
The set $\Gamma$ is called the \emph{antecedent}, the set $\Delta$ is called the \emph{succedent}.
A sequent is written as $\Gamma \vdash \Delta$ with the elements of $\Gamma$ and $\Delta$ listed in an arbitrary order.
\end{dfn}
