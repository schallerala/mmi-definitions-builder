All context-free languages are recursively enumerable because every pushdown automaton can be simulated by a Turing machine.
One can show that context-free languages are also recursive.

If a language is recursively enumerable but not recursive,
then every Turing machine accepting it will run forever on some input word not belonging to the language.
Later we will give an example of such a language.
