Multinomial theorem
The numbers

nk_1, , k_r

are called multinomial coefficients.
(It would be just logical to call  a trinomial coefficient.
Unfortunately, this term is sometimes used for the entries in an analog of Pascal triangle,
where every number is equal to the sum of three numbers from the previous line, so a confusion may arise...)
Similarly to the binomial coefficients, the multinomial coefficients appear in the expansion of the -th power of a sum.
Now the sum has not two, but  terms.
