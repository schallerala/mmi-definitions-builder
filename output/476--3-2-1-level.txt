A proof theory is a method of establishing the validity of a proposition (that is whether a given proposition is a tautology).
There is a type of proof theories called deductive systems.
A deductive system consists of

a set of propositional formulas called axioms;
a set of inference rules.

An inference rule has the form , where  is a proposition and  is a set of propositions.
It is convenient to write an axiom  in the form .
This allows to define provable propositions recursively.
