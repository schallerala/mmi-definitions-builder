\begin{exl}
The language of words consisting of alternating $0$'s and $1$'s.
It can be represented by a regular expression $(01)^* + (10)^* + 0(10)^* + 1(01)^*$.
In this expression a case distinction is incorporated: if the word is of even length and starts with $0$,
then it belongs to the language $(01)^*$, etc.

The same language can be described by the expression
\[
(01)^* + 1(01)^* + (01)^*0 + 1(01)^*0 = (\epsilon + 1)(01)^*(\epsilon + 0).
\]
