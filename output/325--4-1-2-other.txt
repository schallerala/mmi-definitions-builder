One can rectify any formula by renaming the variables as follows.

For every quantifier in the formula determine its "scope".
For this, look at the recursive structure of the formula,
namely at the step when the quantifier appeared: .
The subformula  is the scope of .
If the variable  bound by a quantifier occurs not only inside the scope,
but also outside, then replace all occurrences of  inside the scope and under the quantifier by some completely new symbol.
itemize

The resulting formula is semantically equivalent to the original one (although we have not yet described the semantics).
