Duality for embedded graphs
Let  be a connected plane graph.
Define a new plane graph  as follows.
Inside every face  of  choose a point .
For every edge  of  draw an arc  crossing the edge  and joining the points  and  inside the faces incident with .
(If  is incident to one face only, then the arc  is a loop.)

It is possible to draw all arcs  so that they do not intersect each other.
(Mark a point in the interior of every edge;
inside every face , join the point  to the points marked on the incident edges in a non-self-intersecting way.)

See Figure fig:DualGraph for an example.

Different planar embeddings of the same graph may have different duals.
For example, consider the duals of the graphs on Figure fig:TwoEmbeddings.

Let us describe those graphs whose duals have no loops and multiple edges.
