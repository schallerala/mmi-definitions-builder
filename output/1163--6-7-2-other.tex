Recall that a derivation of a word in a context-free grammar can be represented in the form of a derivation tree,
see Figure \ref{fig:Chomsky}.
(Sometimes different trees can derive the same word, but this is not a problem.)
If the grammar has Chomsky form, then its derivation trees are binary trees.
More exactly, a derivation tree of a Chomsky form grammar is a full binary tree (variable nodes)
together with an additional edge hanging down from every leaf (terminal nodes).
