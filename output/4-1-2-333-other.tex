A variable in a predicate formula may be \emph{bound} by a quantifier or be \emph{free}.
For example, in the formula $\forall x P(x,y)$ the variable $x$ is bound, while the variable $y$ is free.

Unfortunately, this is not as simple as it seems.
Consider the formula
\[
(\forall x P(x,y)) \to (\exists y Q(y)).
\]
The variable $y$ in the first half of the formula is free, the same variable $y$ in the second half is bound.
It is more convenient to work with formulas where such things do not happen.
