If we prove this lemma, then the formula for  follows immediately:
multline*
c_n = 2nn - 2nn-1 = (2n)!n!n! - (2n)!(n+1)!(n-1)!

= (2n)!(n+1)!n!((n+1) - n) = 1n+1 2nn.

proof[Proof of Lemma lem:NonDyck]
Let  be the first point where a non-Dyck path enters the triangle below the diagonal.
The number  can take any value between  (which means that the first step goes below the diagonal) and .
Reflect the part of the path from  to  as shown in Figure fig:NonDyckCount.

This transforms every non-Dyck path to a path from  to .
For every path from  to  there is a unique non-Dyck path that produces it.
To reconstruct this non-Dyck path, apply the same operation: take the first point of the form  on the path to 
and reflect the part of the path after this point.
