The main question which will be studied is:
\begin{center}
\sc{What languages are regular?}
\end{center}

In other words, what decision problems can be solved by DFAs?
For example, is there a DFA with the alphabet of propositional logic, which can tell if a given sequence of symbols is a tautological propositional formula?
