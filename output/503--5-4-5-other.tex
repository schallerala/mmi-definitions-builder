\begin{proof}
Let us show that the sequence $d_n$ of numbers of Dyck paths satisfies the same recurrence relation that the sequence of Catalan numbers.
Take a path from $(0,0)$ to $(n+1,n+1)$ and let $(k+1,k+1)$ be the first point after $(0,0)$ where it touches the diagonal.
The number $k$ can take any value between $0$ and $n$.
The point $(k+1,k+1)$ separates the path into two parts.
The first part never touches the diagonal except at the endpoints.
If we remove from it the initial and the terminal segments, then we get a Dyck path from $(1,0)$ to $(k+1,k)$.
It can be identified by translation with a Dyck path from $(0,0)$ to $(k,k)$.
The part of the path after the point $(k+1,k+1)$ can be identified with a Dyck path from $(0,0)$ to $(n-k,n-k)$.

Conversely, from any $k$-Dyck path and any $(n-k)$-Dyck path one can build a $(n+1)$-Dyck path
by ``lifting up'' the $k$-path and concatenating it with the $(n-k)$-path.
Thus the number of $(n+1)$-Dyck paths whose first contact with the diagonal is at $(k+1, k+1)$ is $d_k d_{n-k}$,
and the total number of $(n+1)$-Dyck paths is
\[
d_{n+1} = \sum_{k=0}^n d_k d_{n-k}.
\]
Thus we have for the sequence $d_n$ the same recursive relation, and also the same starting value $d_0 = 1$.
It follows that $d_n = c_n$ for all $n$.
