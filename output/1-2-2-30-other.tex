To summarize, we have found that the number of elements in each of the following sets is $2^n$:
\begin{itemize}
\item
Maps from an $n$-element set to $\{0,1\}$.
\item
Subsets of an $n$-element set.
\item
Outcomes in tossing a coin $n$ times.
\item
Binary sequences of length $n$.
\end{itemize}

Between any two of these sets there is a natural bijection.
Some of these bijections were described above.
