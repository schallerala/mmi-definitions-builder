\begin{dfn}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph on $n$ vertices.
Denote the vertices by $v_1, \ldots, v_n$ (in an arbitrary order).
The \emph{adjacency matrix} of $G$ (with respect to a given ordering of vertices) is an $n \times n$ matrix $A$ with the following entries
\[
a_{ij} =
\begin{cases}
1 &\text{if } \{v_i, v_j\} \in E\\
0 &\text{if } \{v_i, v_j\} \notin E.
\end{cases}
\]
