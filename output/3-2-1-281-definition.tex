\begin{dfn}
\label{dfn:HilbertProof}
A \emph{formal proof} is a sequence of propositional formulas,
where each formula is an axiom or is obtained from some of the previous formulas by an inference rule.
That is, if $\Gamma \vdash A$ is an inference rule and the sequence already contains all the formulas from the list $\Gamma$,
then you can add $A$ at the end of the sequence.

The final formula of a formal proof is called a \emph{theorem}.
