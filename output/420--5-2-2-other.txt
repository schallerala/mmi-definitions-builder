(Note that it is also well-defined for any value of  provided that  is a polynomial, but we are not going to need this.)

The composition is compatible with sum and product:
gather*
if  C(x) = A(x) + B(x),  then  C(D(x)) = A(D(x)) + B(D(x)),

if  C(x) = A(x)B(x),  then  C(D(x)) = A(D(x))B(D(x)).
gather*

This implies in particular that for every formal power series  with  one has

(1 - B(x))^-1 = 1 + B(x) + (B(x))^2 + .
