The case of complex roots
Back to the case of a recursive sequence of order 2, what happens if the characteristic polynomial

x^2 - rx - s

has no real roots? This happens when the discriminant  is negative.
Then it has two complex roots

_1,2 = r D2,

and all arguments remain valid: the geometric progressions  solve the recurrence and every sequence satisfying the recurrence
can be written as a linear combination of these two progressions.

The two complex roots are conjugate to each other:

_1 = , _2 = .

A linear combination of the progressions  and  takes real values only if the coefficients are conjugate:

a_n = c ^n + c ^n.


Let us write the roots in the exponential form:

= e^i = (+ i ),  = e^-i = (- i).

Then we have
multline*
c ^n + c ^n
= ^n(ce^in + ce^-in)

= ^n(c(n+ in) + c(n- in))

= ^n((c+c) n+ i(c-c) n)
multline*
That is, every recursive sequence is a linear combination with real coefficients of the following two sequences:

^n nand ^n n.


Consider the special case .
Then the recursive relation has the form

a_n = r a_n-1 - a_n-2,

where .
If  is a rational multiple of , then this sequence will be periodic independently of the initial values .
For example, this is the case of the recurrence

a_n = a_n-1 - a_n-2

Here , and the sequence will have period .
(This is also easy to check by iterating the recurrence relation and writing  in terms of  and .)
If  is not a rational multiple of , then the sequence will not be periodic.
It will fill densely some interval.
This is the case of the recurrence

a_n = a_n-12 - a_n-2.
