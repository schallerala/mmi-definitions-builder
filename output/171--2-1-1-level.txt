Types of graphs
Intuitively, a graph is a set of points, some of which are joined by lines.
The points are called vertices of the graph, the lines are called edges of the graph.
Quite often, we represent a graph by drawing it in the plane.
For some graphs, one can draw the edges in such a way that they do not intersect.
But for other graphs self-intersections are inavoidable.
In order not to confuse the intersection points with the "true" vertices, we draw the vertices as small disks.
See Figure fig:TwoDrawings for two drawings of the same graph: one with, the other without self-intersections.

Let us give a formal definition.
