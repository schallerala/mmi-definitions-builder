At each moment of time, the machine is situated opposite to some cell of the input tape.
The input symbol  and the current state  of the machine determine its move 
which consists in:

changing the state to ,
replacing the symbol  in the current cell by ,
and moving in the direction  (one cell to the left if  or one cell to the right if ).

At the beginning, the machine is placed at the leftmost cell of the tape and is in the state .
The language accepted by  is the set of all input words for which  enters a final state at some moment of time.
After entering a final state, the machine halts, that is  is undefined for all .
If the input word is not accepted, then the machine either halts in a non-final state or runs forever
(in an infinite loop or by increasing the data volume on the tape to infinity).
