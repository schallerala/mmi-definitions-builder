This is our original definition: $\binom{n}{k}$ is the number of
unordered choices of $k$ elements out of $n$. In a more abstract
language, this is the number of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element
set.

We have proved that $$\label{eqn:NChooseK}
\binom{n}{k} = \frac{n(n-1)\cdot \ldots \cdot (n-k+1)}{k!} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}.$$
