% Let $G = (X \cup Y, E)$ be a bipartite graph.
% Since every edge joins a vertex from $X$ with a vertex from $Y$, there can be a perfect matching only if $|X| = |Y|$.
% We will assume that $|X| \le |Y|$ and look for a matching that covers all of $X$.
% 
% For example, let $X$ be a set of people and $Y$ be a set of jobs.
% The edge set is formed by those pairs $\{x,y\}$ where the person $x$ is qualified for the job $y$.
% To find a matching that covers $X$ means to assign all people to jobs for which they are qualified.
