One can give an exact meaning to the words ``how many times was an element counted''.
Instead of the intersections $A_i \cap A_j$ etc. consider their indicator functions $\mathbf{1}_{A_i \cap A_j}$.
Instead of summing the cardinalities, sum these functions.
The diagrams on Figures \ref{fig:IncExc2} and \ref{fig:IncExc3} show the values of certain sums of indicator functions.
The argument in the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:IncExc} shows that
\begin{multline*}
\mathbf{1}_{|A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_n|} = \sum_{i=1}^n \mathbf{1}_{|A_i|} - \sum_{1 \le i < j \le n} \mathbf{1}_{|A_i \cap A_j|}
+ \sum_{1 \le i < j < k \le n} \mathbf{1}_{|A_i \cap A_j \cap A_k|} - \cdots \\
\cdots +(-1)^{n-1} \mathbf{1}_{|A_1 \cap \cdots \cap A_n|}
\end{multline*}
by comparing the values of the functions on the left and on the right at every point.
The formula for the number of elements is obtained by taking the ``integrals'' of both sides,
that is replacing each function $f$ by the number $\sum_{x \in A_1 \cup \cdots \cup A_n} f(x)$.
