Indeed, a permutation of an $n$-element set $X$ can be thought of as a bijection $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \to X$.

The same number appears as the answer to a different problem.
Imagine that we have a bag with $n$ balls.
We take out $k$ balls consecutively and lay them in a line in the order in which they were taken.
How many different outcomes are there?
