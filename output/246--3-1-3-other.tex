\begin{proof}
The set of all valuations is non-empty.
Therefore if all valuations satisfy $A$, then there is at least one valuation that satisfies $A$.

From the truth table for $\neg$ it follows that
\[
v \vDash A \text{ if and only if } v \nvDash \neg A.
\]
It follows that $A$ is satisfied by all valuations if and only if $\neg A$ is not satisfied by any.
\end{proof}

The problem of determining whether a given proposition is satisfiable is called \emph{satisfiability problem}, abbreviated $SAT$.
The problem of determining whether a given proposition is a tautology is called \emph{tautology problem}, abbreviated $TAUT$.
The satisfiability problem is $NP$-complete, that is every non-deterministically solvable in polynomial time problem can be reduced to it.
Therefore if $SAT$ can be solved in polynomial time, then every $NP$-problem can, that is $P=NP$.
On the other hand, if $TAUT$ is not $NP$, then $P \ne NP$.
