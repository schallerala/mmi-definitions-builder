proof
The set of all valuations is non-empty.
Therefore if all valuations satisfy , then there is at least one valuation that satisfies .

From the truth table for  it follows that

v A  if and only if  v A.

It follows that  is satisfied by all valuations if and only if  is not satisfied by any.
proof

The problem of determining whether a given proposition is satisfiable is called satisfiability problem, abbreviated .
The problem of determining whether a given proposition is a tautology is called tautology problem, abbreviated .
The satisfiability problem is -complete, that is every non-deterministically solvable in polynomial time problem can be reduced to it.
Therefore if  can be solved in polynomial time, then every -problem can, that is .
On the other hand, if  is not , then .
