% \begin{proof}
% It suffices to prove that a graph with $n$ vertices and without cycles is connected if and only if it has $n-1$ edges.
% A graph without cycles is a forest,
% and by Corollary \ref{cor:ForestEdges} its number of edges is the number of vertices minus the number of components.
% A graph is connected if and only if it has just one component.
% This implies the statement.
