\subsection{Grammars in Chomsky form}
A grammar is said to be in \emph{Chomsky form} if all of its productions are of the form $A \to BC$ and $A \to a$.
According to our notation convention, $A, B, C$ are variables and $a$ is a terminal.
Note that the ``English grammar'' from the beginning of Section \ref{sec:LangGram} is in Chomsky form.
