proof
If we have an algorithm for computing , then modify it by going into an endless loop if the output is .
This computes the function . The function  is computed similarly.

If one has an algorithm which stops only for inputs  and an algorithm which stops only for inputs , then run them parallelly
and interpret the output of the first algorithm as , and the output of the second algorithm as .
This allows us to compute the function .
