\begin{proof}
The graph $T - v$ is acyclic, because it is a subgraph of an acyclic graph.
It remains to prove that $T - v$ is connected.
Let $x$ and $y$ be two vertices of $T$ different from $v$.
There is a path in $T$ connecting $x$ and $y$.
This path does not contain $v$, because otherwise the degree of $v$ would be at least $2$.
Thus it can be considered as a path in $T - v$, so $x$ and $y$ are connected within $T - v$.
\end{proof}
