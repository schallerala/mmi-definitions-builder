\begin{proof}
Let $L \subset \Delta^*$ be a regular language, and $h \colon \Sigma^* \to \Delta^*$ a homomorphism.
Let $M = (Q, \Delta, \delta, q_0, F)$ be a DFA accepting $L$.
We will construct a DFA accepting $h^{-1}(L)$ thus proving that this language is regular.
The idea is to use the same set of states and the same set of final states, but interpret each symbol $a \in \Sigma$ as $h(a) \in \Delta$.
Then a word $w \in \Sigma^*$ will be accepted by the new automaton if and only if $h(w)$ was accepted by the old one.
Formally, put
\[
M' = (Q, \Sigma, \delta', q_0, F), \text{ where }\delta'(q, a) = \widehat{\delta}(q, h(a)).
\]
It can be shown by induction on the length of a word $w$ that $\widehat{\delta'}(q, w) = \widehat{\delta}(q, h(w))$.
Thus we have
\[
w \in L(M') \Leftrightarrow \widehat{\delta'}(q, w) \in F \Leftrightarrow \widehat{\delta}(q, h(w)) \in F \Leftrightarrow h(w) \in L
\Leftrightarrow w \in h^{-1}(L),
\]
which means $L(M') = h^{-1}(L)$.
\end{proof}
