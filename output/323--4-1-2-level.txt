Free and bound variables
A variable in a predicate formula may be bound by a quantifier or be free.
For example, in the formula  the variable  is bound, while the variable  is free.

Unfortunately, this is not as simple as it seems.
Consider the formula

(x P(x,y)) (y Q(y)).

The variable  in the first half of the formula is free, the same variable  in the second half is bound.
It is more convenient to work with formulas where such things do not happen.
