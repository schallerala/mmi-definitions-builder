The only property of the sequence of perfect squares that was used is the existence of arbitrarily large gaps.
Therefore any language of the form $\{0^{a_k}\}$,
where $a_k$ is a monotone sequence of integers such that for every $n$ there is $k$ such that $a_{k+1} - a_k > n$, is non-regular.
Later we will be able to show that the only regular languages of the form $\{0^{a_k}\}$ are those for which the sequence $a_k$ is periodic.
