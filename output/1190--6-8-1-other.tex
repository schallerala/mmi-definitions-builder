\begin{proof}
A recursive language is recursively enumerable by definition.
Its complement is also recursively enumerable: take the same machine and replace $F$ by $Q \setminus F$.

If $L$ and $\Sigma^* \setminus L$ are recursively enumerable,
then one lets the corresponding machine run on the same input word $w$.
At least one of the machines will halt and tell us whether $w \in L$ or not.
\end{proof}

We do not go into details how one can combine two Turing machines into one,
but this can be done with the techniques similar to those we used to design new finite automata.
