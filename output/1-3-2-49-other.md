Take the square lattice in the plane. The nodes of the lattice can be
identified with pairs of integers $(k,l)$ (Cartesian coordinates). Take
two non-negative integers $k, l$ and mark the points $(0,0)$ and
$(k,l)$. A *lattice path* from $(0,0)$ to $(k,l)$ is a sequence of
segments of the square lattice that leads from $(0,0)$ to $(k,l)$. A
lattice path is called *monotone* if it runs only upwards and to the
right. See an example on Figure
[\[fig:MonPath\]](#fig:MonPath){reference-type="ref"
reference="fig:MonPath"}.
