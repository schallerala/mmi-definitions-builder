proof
Let  be the set of all possible ordered choices of  balls out of ,
and  be the set of all unordered choices of  balls.
There is a map  (the "forgetful map") that associates to
an ordered collection of  balls the same set of balls, but unordered.
(The balls lying in a line are put into another bag.)

For , what is the cardinality of its preimage ?
This is the number of ways to order an unordered set of  balls.
An ordering is a bijection to the set , and from Corollary cor:NumberOfBijections we know that there are  of them.
Therefore by the quotient rule we have

Y = Xk! = n(n-1)(n-k+1)k!.

proof

As we already said, an unordered choice of  balls out of  is also called a -combination.
Yet another name of this is a -element subset of a given -element set.
(By definition, a set is an unordered collection of elements.)


Notation.
The number of -element subsets of an -element set is denoted by 
(pronounced " choose ").
