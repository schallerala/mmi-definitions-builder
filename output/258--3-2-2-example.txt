Let us prove the tautology .
First, substitute in the second axiom  for  and  for :

(A ((A A) A)) ((A (A A)) (A A))

Now substitute  for  in the first axiom:

(A ((A A) A))

This coincides with the "left half" of the previous formula, so by modus ponens we infer the "right half" of that formula:

(A (A A)) (A A)

Now take the first axiom with  substituted for :

(A (A A)).

This is the left half of the previous formula, so again by modus ponens we infer

(A A),

and the proof is finished.
