One can omit some of the brackets in regular expressions by adopting the convention that  precedes the concatenation, and the concatenation precedes the sum.
For example,  may be written as , and we have

01^* + 0 = 0, 01, 011, 0111, .


Two regular expressions are called equivalent if they describe the same language.
Here are some simple equivalences:

(rs)t rs(t), (r+s)t rs + rt.

Instead of the equivalence sign we will use the equality sign to denote the equivalence of regular expressions.
For example,

01^* + 0 = 01^*, r = , r = r.





Recall that a language is called regular if there is a finite automaton (DFA, NFA, or -NFA, which does not matter, as we have shown)
that accepts this language.
The main theorem is the following.
