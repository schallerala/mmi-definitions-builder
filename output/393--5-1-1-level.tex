\section{Linear recursive sequences}
\subsection{Fibonacci sequence and Binet formula}
The \emph{Fibonacci sequence} is defined as follows:
\[
a_1 = 1, \quad a_2 = 1, \quad a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2} \text{ for }n > 2.
\]
Here are the first several terms:
\[
1,\ 1,\ 2,\ 3,\ 5,\ 8,\ 13,\ 21,\ 34,\ 55,\ 89,\ \ldots
\]
