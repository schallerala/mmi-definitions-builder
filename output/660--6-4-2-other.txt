proof
Assume that  is regular.
Take a DFA that accepts .
Let  be its states, and  be the initial state.
Denote

T_i = w ^* (q_0, w) = q_i.

One has

^* = T_0 T_1 T_n.

We claim that every  is a subset of some  from the decomposition eqn:SigmaEqClasses.
In other words, every  is the union of one or several ,
which means that the number of -equivalence classes is at most  and implies the first part of the theorem.

In order to prove the claim it suffices to show that if  and  belong to the same , then .
Then for every  one has

(q_0, ux) = ((q_0,u), x) = (q_i, x)
= ((q_0,v), x) = (q_0, vx).

Since both words  and  bring us to the same state, they either both belong to  (if this state is final)
or both not belong to  (if this state is not final).
Thus .


In the opposite direction, let , where .
Construct a DFA with states , the initial state , and the transition function defined as follows.
To find , take some  and look in which class the word  lies.
If , then put .
The result is independent of the choice of a representative .
Indeed, by Lemma lem:LEquivRInvar .
A state  is designated as final if and only if .
It is easy to see that the language accepted by this automaton is .
