proof
Proof by contraposition.
Let  be an inconsistent theory: there is a sentence  such that  and .
Assume that  is satisfiable: .
Then the soundness of the proof system implies that  and , which is a contradiction.
Thus every inconsistent theory is unsatisfiable.
proof

The inverse implication is also correct; it can be derived from the completeness theorem and vice versa by some manipulations with deduction trees.
Therefore it is also called the completeness theorem.
