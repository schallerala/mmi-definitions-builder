\label{exl:WW}
The language $L = \{ww \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}$ is not context-free.
Assume it is, and let $n$ be a pumping bound for this language.
Take the word $z = 0^n1^n0^n1^n \in L$ and write it as $z = uvwxy$ according to the pumping lemma.
By the lemma, the word $z' = uwy$ is in $L$, we will however show that this is impossible.

The subword $vwx$ is contained within some two consecutive blocks (inside $0^n1^n$ or $1^n0^n$).
If $vwx$ is contained in the first half, then while transforming $z$ to $z'$ we removed some symbols from the first half.
It follows that $uwy = 0^k1^l0^n1^n$, where $k, l \le n$ and at least one of them is $<n$.
This word does not belong to $L$.
Similarly, for the other situations of $vwx$ the depumped word has the form $0^n1^k0^l1^n$ or $0^n1^n0^k1^l$ and does not belong to $L$ either.
