\begin{proof}
Let us prove the uniqueness.
If we know $h(a)$ for all $a \in \Sigma$, then we have no other choice but put
\[
h(a_1 \ldots a_n) = h(a_1) \ldots h(a_n).
\]
Also by definition of a homomorphism one has
\[
h(x) = h(\epsilon x) = h(\epsilon) h(x),
\]
which implies $h(\epsilon) = \epsilon$.
Thus there is no more than one homomorphism with given values on the letters of the alphabet.

On the other hand, putting $h(a_1 \ldots a_n) = h(a_1) \ldots h(a_n)$ and $h(\epsilon) = \epsilon$ defines a homomorphism,
so the extension exists and is unique.
\end{proof}
