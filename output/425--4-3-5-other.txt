proof[Proof of Theorem thm:ConstUndecid]
Assume that  is decidable.
Consider the set

X = (m,n) m = A(), T A[n/] ^2.

(Here  means that  has one free variable, and  means substitution of term  for this variable.)
Since  is decidable, the set  is recursive (there is an algorithm which decides whether  or not).

Now let

Y = n (n,n) X.

Clearly, since  is recursive, so is .
By Theorem thm:ReprThm, the set  is representable.
That is, there is a formula  such that
gather*
n Y PA_0 B[n/y]

n Y PA_0 B[n/y]
gather*
Since , for every  such that  we also have .

Now let .
Let us ask ourselves if  or not. Assume .
By definition of , , and  we have

n Y (n,n) X T B[n/y] T B[n/y].

On the other hand, by definition of  we have

n Y T B[n/y],

which implies that  is incoherent.
If we assume that , then we derive similarly that  and .

Thus the decidability assumption contradicts the consistency assumption, and the theorem is proved.
