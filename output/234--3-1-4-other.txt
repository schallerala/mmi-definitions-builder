proof
First let us find a formula that represents a very simple function: a function that takes value  at one point only.
Take any vector  and put

f(x) = 1, f(y) = 0  for all y x.

We need a propositional formula with symbols  that evaluates to  only when  for all .
This is achieved by a conjunction

B = C_1 C_2 C_n,

where

C_i =
cases
p_i, & if  x_1 = 1,

p_i, & if x_1 = 0.
cases

Let us prove that  in a formal way.
Take any .
By definition,  for the valuation .
Apply the recursive definition of :

f_B(y) = v(B) = v(C_1) v(C_2) v(C_n).

The right hand side is equal to  if and only if  for all .
By definition of  we have
align*
if x_i = 1, &then v(C_i) = v(p_i) = v(p_i) = y_i

if x_i = 0, &then  v(C_i) = v(p_i) = v(p_i) = y_i,
align*
which implies that  if and only if .
It follows that  if and only if  for all , that is .

Now let  be an arbitrary Boolean function of  arguments.
If  for all , then one can represent  by the formula .
Assume that there is at least one  such that .
For every  such that  construct a conjunction  as above and take the disjunction of all such :

A = _f(x)=1 B_x.

We claim that .
Indeed,  evaluates to  if and only if at least one of  evaluates to 
and, as we know,  evaluates to  only at .
Thus  evaluates to  exactly at those points where .

Formally, for every  we have

f_A(y) = v(A) = _f(x)=1 v(B_x)

(where ).
The right hand side equals  if and only if  for some .
But  if and only if .
Thus  if and only if  for some  such that , which is just a complicated way to say if and only if .
Hence , and the theorem is proved.
proof

The above argument provides a procedure of writing a formula with a given truth table.
We will illustrate it on the example of the function given by the table below.

Mark the rows with  at the end.
For each of these rows write a conjunction of all proposition symbols, negated or not depending on whether the value of this symbol in this row is  or .
In our case these are  and .
Then write the disjunction of the obtained conjunctions:

(p q) (p q).


Observe that the formula constructed in Theorem thm:BooleNF does not use the connective .
