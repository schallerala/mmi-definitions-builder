\begin{thm}
\label{thm:RestrPart}
The number of partitions of $n$ into exactly $k$ parts is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ with the largest part equal to $k$.

The number of partitions of $n$ into at most $k$ parts is equal to the number of partitions of $n$ into parts that do not exceed $k$.
