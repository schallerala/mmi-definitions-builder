Balanced bracket sequences are characterized by the property that,
when reading it from the left to the right, the number of closing brackets never exceeds the number of opening brackets.
This leads to a natural bijection with Dyck paths: interpret an opening bracket as a step upwards, and a closing bracket as a step to the right.
