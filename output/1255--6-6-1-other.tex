There are two versions of acceptance criteria.
In the first, a word $w$ is accepted if some sequence of moves corresponding to the input $w$ leads to an empty stack
(which means that the start symbol $Z_0$ on the bottom of the stack should also be removed).
In this case the set of final states is irrelevant, one may put $F = \emptyset$.

In the second version, a word $w$ is accepted if some sequence of moves corresponding to the input $w$ brings the automaton to a final state.

A PDA is \emph{deterministic} if every set $\delta(q, a, Z) \cup \delta(q, \epsilon, Z)$ contains at most one element
(from every state and every input symbol at most one move is possible, taking $\epsilon$-transitions into account).
Note however that $\delta(q, a, Z) = \emptyset$ means that in the state $q$ with top stack symbol $Z$
the input symbol $a$ is rejected (or ``breaks'' the automaton).
