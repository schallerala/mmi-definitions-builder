Multinomial coefficients
Words with repeating letters
Consider the following problem:

How many different words of length  can be written with  letters ,  letters , and  letters ?

We have  places for the letters.
First choose  places where to put the letters .
This can be done in  different ways.
Then from  remaining places choose  places where to put the letters .
This can be done in  different ways.
Thus by the (general) product rule the number of different words is

nk n-kl = n!k!(n-k)! (n-k)!l!(n-k-l)! = n!k!l!m!.


We might have started by choosing  places for the letters , and then, say, choose  places for the letters .
Then we would compute the product

nl n-lm

which is the same.

The following notation is used:

n!k!l!m! =: nk, l, m.


Let us now consider a more general problem and solve it in a different way.
