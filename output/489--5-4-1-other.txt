proof
Take a binary tree with  leaves and remove its root.
This splits the tree into two parts: the left subtree and the right subtree, see Figure fig:InductionCatalanTrees.
Each of them is either a full binary tree or a single vertex.
If the left subtree contains  leaves, then the right subtree contains  leaves
(if the subtree has only one vertex, then the number of leaves is one).
For every , there are  possible left subtrees and  possible right subtrees.
This leads to the formula.
