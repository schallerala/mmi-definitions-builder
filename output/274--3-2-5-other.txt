A parent vertex in a rooted tree is a vertex with the out-degree  in the canonical orientation of the edges, see Figure fig:RootedTreeOrient.
Vertices of out-degree  will be called leaves of a rooted tree.
Since the in-degree of every non-root vertex is , non-root leaves are leaves in the usual sense.
However, the root is a leaf if and only if the tree has only one vertex.

A standalone sequent is a simplest deduction tree (tree with one vertex).
Next to it are the deduction trees copied from the inference rules as shown in Figure fig:DeductionTree.
Note that a deduction tree the root is at the bottom, and the children of every vertex are situated above the vertex.
