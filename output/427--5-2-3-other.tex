Note that $\overline{P}(x)$ is related to the characteristic polynomial $P(x)$ through
\[
\overline{P}(x) = x^k P\left(\frac1x\right).
\]
It follows that the roots of the polynomial $\overline{P}(x)$ are reciprocals of the roots of $P(x)$.
More exactly, if $P(x) = (x - \lambda_1)^{k_1} \cdots (x - \lambda_m)^{k_m}$, then
\[
\overline{P}(x) = (1 - \lambda_1 x)^{k_1} \cdots (1- \lambda_m x)^{k_m}.
\]

The following theorem generalizes our representation of the fraction $\frac{x}{1-x-x^2}$ as a sum of two simpler fractions.
