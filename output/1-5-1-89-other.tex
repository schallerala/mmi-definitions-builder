\begin{proof}
We will show that every element of the union is counted exactly once on the right hand side of the formula.

(Can make a warm-up for the elements in the intersection of all sets.)
Take an element that belongs to exactly $k$ of the sets $A_1, \ldots, A_n$.
In the first sum on the right hand side it is counted $k$ times,
in the second sum $\binom{k}{2}$ times, and so on.
In total, this element is counted with the multiplicity
\[
\binom{k}{1} - \binom{k}{2} + \cdots + (-1)^{k-1}\binom{k}{k}.
\]
Due to Theorem \ref{thm:BinAltern}, this sum is equal to $\binom{k}{0} = 1$.
\end{proof}
