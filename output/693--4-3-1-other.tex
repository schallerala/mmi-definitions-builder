\begin{proof}
Assume $T$ is complete, and let $M$ be any of its models.
For every sentence $A$, we have either $M \vDash A$ or $M \vDash \neg A$.
Due to the completeness of $T$ this implies $T \vDash A$, respectively $T \vDash \neg A$.

Assume $T$ is incomplete. Then there are two models $M$ and $M'$ whose sets of satisfied formulas differ.
Without loss of generality, let $M \vDash A$ and $M' \not\vDash A$.
Then neither $T \vDash A$ nor $T \vDash \neg A$ hold.
\end{proof}
