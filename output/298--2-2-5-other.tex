In particular, for the complete graph we have the determinant of the following $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ matrix:
\[
\det
\begin{pmatrix}
n-1 & -1 & \cdots & -1\\
-1 & n-1 & \cdots & -1\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots\\
-1 & -1 & \cdots & n-1
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Cayley's theorem indicates that it is equal to $n^{n-2}$.
Of course, it is easier (but still not straightforward) to prove this equality without invoking two difficult theorems above.
