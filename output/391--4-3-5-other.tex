\begin{proof}
The set $V$ is the set of theorems of the empty theory. Since the empty theory is recursive, $V$ is recursively enumerable.

Denote by $B$ the conjunction of all seven axioms of $PA_0$.
If $V$ is recursive, then for any sentence $A$ one can decide in finite time whether $B \to A$ belongs to $V$ or not.
But an answer to this question is equivalent to an answer to the question whether $A \in \Th(PA_0)$ or not.
This contradicts the fact that $PA_0$ is undecidable, thus $V$ cannot be recursive.
\end{proof}
