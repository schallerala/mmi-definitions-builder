An infinite (but fast convergent) series that computes  was found by Ramanujan and Hardy and later improved by Rademacher.
A consequences of the latter is the asymptotics for the number of partitions:

p_n 14n3 e^2n/3.

Ramanujan observed and later proved that

p_5n+4  is divisible by  5,

p_7n+5  is divisible by  7,

p_11n+6  is divisible by  11.

Erdos and Lehner proved that a "random" partition of  has  summands.

Both Ramanujan and Erdos were extraordinary figures.

Rooted binary trees
Recall that a rooted tree is a tree with a marked vertex, the root.
We have used rooted trees (with labels at the vertices) as parse trees of propositional formulas
and as proof structures in the sequent calculus.
Edges or a rooted tree have a natural orientation such that the path from the root to every vertex goes in the direction of edges.
The out-degree of a vertex in a rooted tree is the number of outward-directed edges incident to this vertex.
Similarly, the in-degree is the number of inward-directed edges; the in-degree of the root is zero, and the in-degrees of all other vertices are one.

A binary rooted tree is a rooted tree where the out-degrees of all vertices are at most two.
A full binary rooted tree is a rooted tree where the out-degree of each vertex is either two or zero.
(Vertices with out-degree zero are the leaves of the tree.)

With the help of the handshake lemma and the relation  one can show that
a full binary rooted tree with  leaves has  vertices and  edges.
