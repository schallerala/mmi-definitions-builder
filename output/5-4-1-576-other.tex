We count trees not up to isomorphism, but take into account also the way they are drawn in the plane.
For example, Figure \ref{fig:Catalan3Trees} shows all binary trees with $4$ leaves.
(When there is no risk of confusion, by ``binary tree'' we mean ``full binary rooted tree''.)

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{All $5$ binary trees with $4$ leaves.}

\end{figure}

One has $c_1 = 1, c_2 = 2, c_3 = 5, c_4 = 14, \ldots$.
