Assume  is complete, and let  be any of its models.
For every sentence , we have either  or .
Due to the completeness of  this implies , respectively .

Assume  is incomplete. Then there are two models  and  whose sets of satisfied formulas differ.
Without loss of generality, let  and .
Then neither  nor  hold.
