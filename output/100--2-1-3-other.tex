Note that we cannot take any pair of subsets $V' \subset V, E' \subset E$:
if $\{v, w\} \in E'$, then we must have $v, w \in V'$.

An \emph{$n$-cycle} in a graph is a subgraph isomorphic to $C_n$.
Bipartite graphs contain no $3$-cycles, and more generally no cycles of odd length.

\begin{exc}
Prove the converse: if a graph contains no cycles of odd length, then it is bipartite.
\end{exc}

A \emph{Hamiltonian cycle} in a graph is a cycle that contains all of its vertices.
It provides a closed path visiting all of its vertices exactly once
A graph is called \emph{Hamiltonian} if it has a Hamiltonian cycle.
The graph $K_{3,3}$ is Hamiltonian, the Petersen graph is not.
