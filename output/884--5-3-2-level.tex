\subsection{Compositions again}
Recall that a weak composition of a number $n$ is a representation of $n$ as a sum of non-negative integers.
(One counts ordered sums: $5 = 2 + 3$ and $5 = 3 + 2$ are different compositions.)
We have computed the number of weak compositions in Section \ref{sec:Comp} by the ``stones and sticks'' method.
Let us do it again with generating functions.

Fix a positive integer $k$ and denote by $a_n$ the number of weak compositions of $n$ from $k$ parts.
