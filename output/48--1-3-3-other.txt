proof
We know that  is the number of binary words of length  with exactly  digits .
There are two kinds of words like that: those that start with  and those that start with .
How many words of each kind are there?

When we delete the first digit, we are left with a word of length .
For the words of the first kind, this word of length  must contain  digits .
Thus there are  words of the first kind.

Similarly, for a word of second kind we are left with a word of length  that contains  digits .
Thus there are  words of the second kind.

Since every word is either of the first kind or of the second kind but not both,
identity eqn:BinCoeffRec holds.

proof[Proof of Theorem thm:BinPascal]
Let us write the numbers  in a triangle similar to the Pascal triangle:
center
tabularccccccccccc
&    &    &    &    &  

&    &    &    &   &    &  

&    &    &   &    &   &    &  

&    &   &    &   &    &   &    &  

&   &    &   &    &   &    &   &    & 

 &   &   &    &  &    &  &    &   &   & 

tabular
center
The top-left neighbor of the number  is , the top-right neighbor is .
By Lemma lem:BinCoeffRec, the numbers in the -triangle satisfy the same rule that the numbers in the Pascal triangle:
each number is the sum of its top-left and top-right neighbors.
The outermost numbers  and  are also the same as in the Pascal triangle:

n0 = nn = 1.

It follows that the -triangle coincides with the Pascal triangle.
(The formal argument here is proof by induction:
if the -th line of the -triangle coincides with the -th line of the Pascal triangle,
then their -st lines also coincide.)
