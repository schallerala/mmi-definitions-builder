proof[First proof]
Let us establish a bijection between the weak compositions of  from  parts and the compositions of  from  parts.
Indeed, adding  to every summand in a weak composition of  transforms it into a (strong) composition of .
In the opposite direction, subtracting  from every summand of a composition of  transforms it into
a weak composition of .
This is a one-to-one correspondence (a bijection).
By Theorem thm:Compositions, the number of (strong) compositions of  from  parts is , and we are done.
proof

proof[Second proof]
You have  stones and  sticks.
Mark  spots on the ground.
You have to choose  among them where you lay sticks, then you will lay your stones on the remaining spots.
There are  different arrangements, and they correspond to weak compositions of  from  parts.
For example, if the stones are on the first  spots, then the first  summands are equal to zero, and the -th summand equals .
