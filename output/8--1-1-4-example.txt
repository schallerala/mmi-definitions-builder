Draw a convex -gon and all of its diagonals.
How many segments (sides and diagonals) do we get?

Every point belongs to  segments.
If we multiply this by the number of points, we get .
But every segment was counted twice, because it has two endpoints (two "legs").
Thus the total number of segments is .
