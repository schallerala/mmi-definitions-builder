proof
Observe that in a plane graph with  vertices the degree of every face is at least .
Indeed, the only way for a face of a connected graph to have degree  is to enclose an edge, in which case the graph has two vertices and one edge.
A face cannot have degree . And if a face of a connected graph has degree , then the graph consists of a single vertex.

Then from Theorem thm:DualHandshake and Euler's formula we get the inequality

2 E = _f F f 3 F = 3 (2 - V + E),

which implies .
The equality takes place only if the  for all , that is if all faces are triangles.
proof

Theorem thm:3V-6 implies that the graph  is not planar.
Indeed, it has  vertices and  edges.
This proof of non-planarity of  looks very nice and seems to avoid the intricacies of Jordan's curve theorem.
The simplicity is deceiving: Jordan's curve theorem is needed in the proof of Euler's formula (when we say that the cycle separates the plane).

An attempt to prove the non-planarity of  in the same way fails:
this graph has  vertices and  edges.
Note however that a planar embedding of  (if it exists) has no faces of degree  (a bipartite graph contains no odd cycles).
For any plane graph without triangles we have

2 E = _f F f 4 F = 4 (2 - V + E),

which implies .
Since  does not satisfy this inequality: , it is not planar.
