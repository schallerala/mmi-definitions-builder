We will present Gentzen's sequent calculus for predicate logic.
There are other proof theories, for example Hilbert-style systems.
These theories are equivalent to each other, which means that a formula provable within one of them is also provable within any other.
(Postfactum it follows from their soundness and completeness,
but one can describe a transformation of Hilbert proof into a Gentzen proof and vice versa in a direct way.)
