proof
The graph  is acyclic, because it is a subgraph of an acyclic graph.
It remains to prove that  is connected.
Let  and  be two vertices of  different from .
There is a path in  connecting  and .
This path does not contain , because otherwise the degree of  would be at least .
Thus it can be considered as a path in , so  and  are connected within .
