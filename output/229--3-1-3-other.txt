proof
One proves that  if and only if  by a case distinction,
that is by considering all four possible combinations of values  and .
Thus if  for all , then  is a tautology, and vice versa.

There are several simple and useful equivalences between propositional formulas.

The associativity laws allow us to omit parentheses in conjunctions or disjunctions.
Due to it we can allow abuse of notation and write strings like this one:

p q r s.

This is against the syntax rules.
In order to conform the rules, we must put some parentheses.
This leads to several different propositional formulas, like  or .
Although these formulas are different, they are logically equivalent.
Thus, the string  stands for a class of equivalent formulas.

The distributivity laws allow us to operate with brackets as if  is the multiplication and  is the addition
or vice versa.
For example,

p (p q) (p p) (p q).


Let us extend the language  by adding two new symbols  and .
We define a language  by adding to the point 1. in Definition dfn:PropForm that  and  belong to 
and leaving the other conditions as they are.
The symbols  and  are logical constants: when computing the truth value of a proposition 
we replace each  by  and each  by .
In  there are the following logical equivalences.

Laws of zero and one.

These equivalences can be used in order to simplify certain propositions from .
As an example, let us simplify the formula we just obtained.

(p p) (p q) (p q) p q.
