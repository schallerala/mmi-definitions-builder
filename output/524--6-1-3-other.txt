proof
The proof is based on the interpretation of an NFA as "being in several states at the same time".
One constructs a deterministic automaton whose states correspond to sets of states of NFA.

Take any NFA .
Define a DFA  as follows.
itemize
: the states of  are all subsets of the set of states of .
, a one-element set.
, all subsets of  that contain at least one final state of .
For any  put .
itemize

We claim that

q, u) = (q, u)

for all  and all  and prove it by induction on the length of .
If , then both sides are equal to .
Take any word of length at least , and let  be its last letter.
Then this word can be written as , and we have
gather*
q, wa) = q, w), a) = _p q, w) (p, a)

(q, wa) = _p (q,w) (p, a)
gather*
By induction hypothesis, , and the induction step is proved.

Definition of  and definition eqn:NFALanguage imply that .
