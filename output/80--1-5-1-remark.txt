One can give an exact meaning to the words "how many times was an element counted".
Instead of the intersections  etc. consider their indicator functions .
Instead of summing the cardinalities, sum these functions.
The diagrams on Figures fig:IncExc2 and fig:IncExc3 show the values of certain sums of indicator functions.
The argument in the proof of Theorem thm:IncExc shows that

1_A_1 A_n = _i=1^n 1_A_i - _1 i < j n 1_A_i A_j
+ _1 i < j < k n 1_A_i A_j A_k - 

+(-1)^n-1 1_A_1 A_n

by comparing the values of the functions on the left and on the right at every point.
The formula for the number of elements is obtained by taking the "integrals" of both sides,
that is replacing each function  by the number .
