proof
Assume the contrary.
Then there is a Turing machine  which accepts the language .
By inspection of the word  we arrive to a contradiction:
itemize
if , then by definition of  the word  is not accepted by , which by the choice of  means that ;
if , then by definition of  the word  is accepted by , which by the choice of  means that .
itemize
proof


proof[Proof of Theorem thm:HaltingProblem]
If  is recursive, then there is a Turing machine  which always halts and accepts only pairs  from .
Let us show that then  is recursive, which contradicts Lemma lem:LdNotRE.
Given a word  determine the integer  such that .
Then determine the machine .
Feed  into  and accept  if and only if  does not accept .
This gives an algorithm which always stops and recognizes the language .
