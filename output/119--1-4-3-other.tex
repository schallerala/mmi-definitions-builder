\subsection{Monotone paths in higher dimensions}
Consider the cubical grid in $\R^m$.
It is possible to visualize for $m=3$; for larger $m$ one uses an abstract description.
Mark the points $(0, \ldots, 0)$ and $(k_1, \ldots, k_m)$ in this grid.
A monotone path is one that moves along the grid lines and in the positive directions only.
