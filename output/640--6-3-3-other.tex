\begin{proof}
Let $\Sigma$ be the alphabet of the propositional logic.
Consider the homomorphism $h \colon \Sigma^* \to \{0, 1\}^*$ defined by
\[
( \mapsto 0, \quad ) \mapsto 1, \quad x \mapsto \epsilon \text{ for all other symbols of }\Sigma.
\]
Every propositional formula is sent to a balanced bracket sequence (now represented by zeros and ones),
and every balanced bracket sequence is the image of some propositional formula.
If the language of all propositional formulas is regular, then the language of all balanced bracket sequences is also regular.
But it is not, by the pumping lemma: if $n$ is the number from the lemma, then $0^n1^n = uvw$ belongs to the language, but $uv^2w$ is unbalanced.
\end{proof}
