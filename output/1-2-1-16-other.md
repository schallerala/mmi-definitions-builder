A *map* $f \colon X \to Y$ is a rule that associates to every element
$x \in X$ a unique element of $Y$. The element associated to $x$ is
denoted by $f(x)$.

A map can be pictured as a collection of arrows going from elements of
$X$ to elements of $Y$. At every element of $X$ one and only one arrow
must start. By contrast, at an element of $Y$ several arrows or none at
all may end.


A map $f \colon X \to Y$ is called

-   *injective*, if no two different elements of $X$ are sent to the
    same element of $Y$: for every $x_1 \ne x_2$ we have
    $f(x_1) \ne f(x_2)$;

-   *surjective*, if to every element of $Y$ some element of $X$ is
    sent: for every $y \in Y$ there is $x \in X$ such that $f(x) = y$;

-   *bijective*, if it is injective and surjective.
