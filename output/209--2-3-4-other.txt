The faces of the dual graph  correspond to the vertices of :
the duals of the edges incident to  form a cycle around .
Thus we have bijections

V(G) F(G^*), E(G) E(G^*), F(G) V(G^*).


Observe that Theorem thm:DualHandshake is equivalent to the handshake lemma for the dual graph .

Finally, note that the dual of  is  again:

(G^*)^* = G.
