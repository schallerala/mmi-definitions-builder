proof
Count the vertex-edge incidences in two ways.
From the vertices viewpoint, every vertex  is incident to  many edges.
Thus the number of incidences is the sum of the degrees of all vertices.
From the edges viewpoint, every edge is incident to two vertices.
Thus the number of incidences is twice the number of edges.
The theorem follows.
proof
The name "handshake lemma" suggests a reformulation of the above argument.
In a group of people, several handshakes take place. How to count the number of handshakes?
One way to do it is to ask every person how many handshakes it made and to add all these numbers.
Since every handshake is counted twice, we have to divide the result by two.
