\begin{dfn}
A matching $M$ in a graph $G$ is called a \emph{maximum matching} if it has the maximum possible number of edges among all matchings in $G$
(in other words if it covers a maximum possible number of vertices).

A matching is called \emph{inclusion-maximal} if it is not contained in any larger matching.
\end{dfn}
