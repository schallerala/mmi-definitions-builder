\begin{thm}[Kirchhoff]
Let $G$ be a connected graph, and $L$ be its Laplacian matrix.
Then the number of spanning trees of $G$ is equal to each of the following numbers.
\begin{itemize}
\item $(-1)^{i+j} \det L_{ij}$, where $L_{ij}$ is the matrix obtained by removing the $i$-th row and the $j$-th column from $L$;
\item $\frac{1}{n} \lambda_1 \lambda_2 \cdots \lambda_{n-1}$, where $\lambda_i$ are the non-zero eigenvalues of $L$.
\end{itemize}
\end{thm}
