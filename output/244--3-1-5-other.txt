proof
This follows from Theorem thm:BooleNF.
Every formula represents a boolean function.
As we proved in Theorem thm:BooleNF, every boolean function is represented by a formula in DNF.
Formulas representing the same function are logically equivalent.
proof

Similarly, a disjunctive clause is a disjunction of several literals.
