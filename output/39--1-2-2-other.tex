\begin{proof}
Let $|X| = n$. With every subset $A \subset X$ we associate a map $\mathbf{1}_A \colon X \to \{0,1\}$ (the \emph{indicator function} of $A$) defined as
\[
\mathbf{1}_A(x) =
\begin{cases}
1, &\text{if } x \in A,\\
0, &\text{if } x \notin A.
\end{cases}
\]
One can show that $A \mapsto \mathbf{1}_A$ is a bijection between the set of all subsets and the set of all maps $X \to \{0,1\}$:
different subsets define different maps and every map $f$ is the indicator function of the subset $f^{-1}(1) \subset X$.

The number of all maps $X \to \{0,1\}$ is $2^{|X|}$ by Theorem \ref{thm:AllMaps}.
By the bijection principle, the number of all subsets of $X$ is the same.
\end{proof}
