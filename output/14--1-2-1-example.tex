\begin{exl}
Let $X$ be the set of all countries in the world, and $Y$ be the set of all cities in the world.
Define a map $f \colon X \to Y$ by letting $f(x)$ be the capital of the country $x$.
Then $f$ is injective (no city can be the capital of two countries), but not surjective (some cities are not capitals).
Define a map $g \colon Y \to X$ by letting $g(y)$ be the country in which the city $y$ lies.
Then $g$ is surjective (in every country there is at least one city), but not injective (some countries have more than one city).

It is also interesting to look at the compositions $f \circ g$ and $g \circ f$...
