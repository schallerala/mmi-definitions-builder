Let  be a context-free language, and let  be a grammar that generates .
We construct a grammar  by adding to  a new symbol  (which will be the new start symbol) and a new production rule:

V' = V S', P' = P S' SS' .

In  one can derive all words of the Kleene closure :

S' [G'] SS' [G'] SSS' [G'] [G'] SS S [G'] w_1 w_2 w_n.

Vice versa, every word derived from  belongs to .

Let now  and  be languages generated by context-free grammars

G_1 = (V_1, T_1, P_1, S_1), G_2 = (V_2, T_2, P_2, S_2).

Put .
We want to show that the languages  and  are context-free.
In both cases rename the variables so that 
and construct a new grammar  with .
It is easy to see that the production rules

P' = P_1 P_2 S' S_1 S_2

generate the language ,
and the production rules

P' = P_1 P_2 S" S_1S_2.

generate .
