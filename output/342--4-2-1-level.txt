Substitutions
Let  be a predicate formula, and let  be a term.
Assume that  contains a free variable .
Then we can define a new formula  obtained by substitution of  for all free occurrences of .
(We don't exclude the possibility that  also occurs bound in .)

Intuitively,  should represent a special case of , so that for example if  is true for all , then  is valid.
However, some substitutions do not have this property.
Take for example

A = y (y < x), t = y.

Then we have .
This is false in the universe of integers, although  was true.
