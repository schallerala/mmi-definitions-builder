\begin{proof}
Induction on the number of vertices.

For trees with one vertex the statement is trivial.

Assume that the statement is proved for all deduction trees with $< n$ vertices.
Let $T$ be a deduction tree with $n$ vertices.
By definition, if we delete the root of $T$, then we obtain one or two deduction trees ``growing'' from the children of the root,
see Figure \ref{fig:InductionDedTree}.
Besides, the root of $T$ is the conclusion and its children are the premises of an inference rule.
Hence by Lemma \ref{lem:RuleTrees} a valuation falsifies the root if and only if it falsifies one of its children.
The subtrees growing from the children have $< n$ vertices,
therefore by induction assumption a valuation falsifies a child if and only if it falsifies one of the leaves of the corresponding subtree.
Such a vertex is also childless in the big tree.
This proves the induction step.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:GentzenSound}]
We want to show that for every proof tree the sequent at its root is valid.
By Lemma \ref{lem:FalsifyRoot}, if some valuation falsifies the root, then it falsifies one of the leaves.
But all leaves of a proof tree are axioms, and by Lemma \ref{lem:AxiomValid} they cannot be falsified.
\end{proof}
