\begin{exl}
The language $L$ consisting of all binary words with an equal number of zeros and ones is not regular.
Indeed, assume the contrary, and let $n$ be the integer in the pumping lemma.
Then $0^n1^n \in L$.
By the pumping lemma, one can write $0^n1^n = uvw$, where $|uv| \le n$, and $uv^kw \in L$ for all $k$.
It follows that the words $u$ and $v$ consist of zeros only.
Since $|v| \ge 1$, the word $uw = uv^0w$ has less zeros than ones, thus it does not belong to $L$.
This contradiction shows that our assumption was false.
