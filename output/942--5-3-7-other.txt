proof
Partitions of  into  parts can be split into two classes:
partitions into  parts and partitions into exactly  parts.
By definition, the first class contains  partitions.
Take a partition from the second class and subtract  from each of its parts.
Since it had exactly  parts, the sum of the parts becomes ,
and their number becomes  (it will be strictly less than  if the smallest part was of size ,
and exactly  if the smallest part was larger than ).
This establishes a bijection between the second class and partitions of  into  parts
and proves the theorem.
