Disjunctive and conjunctive normal forms
Propositional formulas that we obtained in Theorem thm:BooleNF have a very special form:
they are disjunction of conjunctions of (possibly negated) proposition symbols.

Let us fix some terminology.
A literal is a proposition symbol or its negation.
A conjunctive clause is a conjunction of one or several literals.
