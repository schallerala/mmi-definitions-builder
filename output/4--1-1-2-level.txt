Product rule
First, let us state a special product rule:

X Y = X Y.

Here , the Cartesian product of  and , denotes the set of ordered pairs  with , .

The elements of  can be written in a table whose rows correspond to the elements of ,
and the columns correspond to the elements of .
This justifies the product rule.

Again, there is an extension to several sets:

X_1 X_n = X_1 X_n.
