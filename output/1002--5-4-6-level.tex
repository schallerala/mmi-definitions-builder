\subsection{A combinatorial proof of the formula for $c_n$}
The proof of the formula for $c_n$ in Section \ref{sec:GenFuncCatalan} was algebraic,
building upon the recursive formula \eqref{eqn:CatalanRecursion}.
Since Catalan numbers have so many combinatorial interpretation, it would be good to have a combinatorial proof of the same formula.

Instead of counting Dyck paths let us count paths that enter the triangle below the diagonal.
They may stay all the time below the diagonal or cross the diagonal one or several times.
We call them non-Dyck paths.
