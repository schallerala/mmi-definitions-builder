Note that we cannot take any pair of subsets :
if , then we must have .

An -cycle in a graph is a subgraph isomorphic to .
Bipartite graphs contain no -cycles, and more generally no cycles of odd length.

Prove the converse: if a graph contains no cycles of odd length, then it is bipartite.

A Hamiltonian cycle in a graph is a cycle that contains all of its vertices.
It provides a closed path visiting all of its vertices exactly once
A graph is called Hamiltonian if it has a Hamiltonian cycle.
The graph  is Hamiltonian, the Petersen graph is not.
