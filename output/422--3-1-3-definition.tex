\begin{dfn}
A proposition $A$ is \emph{satisfiable} if it is satisfied by at least one valuation.
A proposition is \emph{unsatisfiable} if it is not satisfied by any valuation.

A proposition $A$ is \emph{valid} or a \emph{tautology} if it is satisfied by all valuations: $\hat{v}(A) = 1$ for all $v$.
We denote this by $\vDash A$.
