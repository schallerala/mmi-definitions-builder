dfn:HilbertProof
A formal proof is a sequence of propositional formulas,
where each formula is an axiom or is obtained from some of the previous formulas by an inference rule.
That is, if  is an inference rule and the sequence already contains all the formulas from the list ,
then you can add  at the end of the sequence.

The final formula of a formal proof is called a theorem.
