A proposition symbol , , , , .
(A countably infinite set.)
A logical connective , , , .
An auxiliary symbol  or .
itemize
Sometimes to the list of logical connectives one adds  and .
We will abstain from this.

The logical connectives have the following names.

center
tabular[c]l@l@l
 & and & conjunction

 & or & disjunction

 & if ..., then ... & implication

 & not & negation
tabular
