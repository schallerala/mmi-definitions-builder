Consider the sentence
center
Colorless green ideas sleep furiously.
center
Although it does not make any sense, it is syntactically correct.
One distinguishes a noun phrase "colorless green ideas" and a verb phrase "sleep furiously".
The noun phrase itself consists of a noun preceeded by adjectives, and the verb phrase consists of a verb followed by adverbs.

More generally, one can formulate the following rules of production of simple English sentences:
align*
&S NV &&a sentence consists of a noun phrase and a verb phrase

&N AdjN &&a noun phrase may start with one or more adjectives

&V VAdv &&a verb phrase may end with one or more adverbs
align*
At any stage one can substitute for , , ,  a word from a dictionary:
align*
&N list of nouns

&V list of verbs

&Adj list of adjectives

&Adv list of adverbs
align*
The result is a syntactically correct (but mostly meaningless) sentence.

A production can be represented linearly:
multline*
S NV AdjNV AdjAdjNV colorless AdjNV

colorless AdjNVAdv multline*

The sentence at the beginning of this section is from a book of Noam Chomsky.
In mid-1950's he proposed the above principles as description of the structure of human languages.
(Of course one needs more production rules in order to be able to generate more complicated sentences.)
A couple of years later John Backus, a programming language designer acquainted with Chomsky's ideas,
described the syntax of the ALGOL programming language in a similar way.

Let us now give an exact definition.
