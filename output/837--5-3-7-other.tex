\begin{proof}
Partitions of $n$ into $\le k$ parts can be split into two classes:
partitions into $\le k-1$ parts and partitions into exactly $k$ parts.
By definition, the first class contains $p(n, \le k-1)$ partitions.
Take a partition from the second class and subtract $1$ from each of its parts.
Since it had exactly $k$ parts, the sum of the parts becomes $n-k$,
and their number becomes $\le k$ (it will be strictly less than $k$ if the smallest part was of size $1$,
and exactly $k$ if the smallest part was larger than $1$).
This establishes a bijection between the second class and partitions of $n-k$ into $\le k$ parts
and proves the theorem.
\end{proof}
