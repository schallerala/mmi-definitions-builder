In other words, when we are substituting  for free occurrences of ,
we also want all parts of  to remain free in the resulting formula.

In order to determine the truth value of a non-closed formula , one needs a structure 
and an assignment  for all free variables in  (that is,  is a map from the set of free variables in  to ).
A formula  is called satisfiable (respectively, falsifiable) in 
if there is an assignment  such that  (respectively, ).
