\begin{exl}
Draw a convex $n$-gon and all of its diagonals.
How many segments (sides and diagonals) do we get?

Every point belongs to $n-1$ segments.
If we multiply this by the number of points, we get $n(n-1)$.
But every segment was counted twice, because it has two endpoints (two ``legs'').
Thus the total number of segments is $\frac{n(n-1)}2$.
