Consider the language of binary palindromes with a symbol  ("center") in the middle:

L = w c w w 0,1^*.

We describe a deterministic PDA accepting  by the empty stack. Put

M = (q_1, q_2, 0, 1, c, A, B, Z_0, , q_1, Z_0, .

While the automaton is in the state , it stores the input in the stack encoding  with  and  with :

(q_1, 0, Z) = (q_1, AZ) (q_1, 1, Z) = (q_1, BZ)  for all Z .

If the input symbol is , then the automaton switches to the state :

(q_1, c, Z) = (q_2, Z)  for all Z .

While in the state , the automaton compares the input symbol with the top symbol in the stack.
If the symbols agree, then the top symbol is removed; if they disagree, the automaton "breaks down".

(q_2, 0, A) = (q_2, ) (q_2, 1, B) = (q_2, )

Finally, when the automaton sees the start symbol at the bottom of the stack, this symbol is removed, and the word is accepted:

(q_2, , Z_0) = (q_2, ).
