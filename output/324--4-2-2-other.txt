Axioms of the Gentzen system are, as before, sequents 
with some formula occurring on both sides: .
Axioms are valid (because no structure can at the same time satisfy and falsify ).
Inference rules for the logical connectives  are the same.
There are four new rules involving the quantifiers.

Here  is any term free for  in , and  is any variable free for  in  and not occurring freely in the conclusion
(that is, in the sequent  for the right  rule and in the sequent 
for the left  rule).
In particular, one can substitute  for itself if  does not occur freely in  and .

As before, a deduction tree is a proof tree if all of its leaves are axioms.
A sequent is called provable if there is a proof tree with this sequent as a root.
