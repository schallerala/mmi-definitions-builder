proof
Recall that

(1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3) = 1 + _n=1^q_n x^n,

because the general term of the brackets expansion on the left hand side is , where all  are different.
Now, when we expand the product , the general term has the form .
Therefore the coefficient at  is the number of partitions into an even number of distinct parts
minus the number of partitions into an odd number of distinct parts.
proof

We have reduced Theorem thm:EulerPenta to the following lemma.
