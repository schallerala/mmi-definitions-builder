Recall that the language $\{a^ib^i \mid i \ge 1\}$ is context-free (Example \ref{exl:0n1n}, slightly modified to exclude the empty word).
The language from the previous example does not look more complicated, however it is no more context-free.

Similarly, we know from Example \ref{exl:Palindromes} that the set of even-length palindromes $\{w \bar{w} \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}$
is a context-free language.
The language of the next example does not look much different, but it is not context-free.
(Althoug it could be accepted by an automaton with a queue memory.)
