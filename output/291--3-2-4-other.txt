proof
The proof is done by looking at the truth tables of the logical connectives.
Let us prove, for example, the ( right) rule:
prooftree



prooftree
A valuation  falsifies the conclusion if and only if
it satisfies all propositions in , falsifies , and falsifies all propositions in .
But  falsifies  if and only if it either falsifies  or falsifies .
Thus  falsifies the conclusion if and only if it
itemize
satisfies  and falsifies  and , or
satisfies  and falsifies  and .
itemize
These conditions are the premises of the ( right) rule, therefore the statement of the lemma holds for this rule.
Similar arguments work for all of the other rules.
proof

For any proposition  one can form a sequent , which is falsifiable, respectively valid, if and only if
 is falsifiable, respectively valid (a tautology).
Thus if we learn to prove all valid sequents, then we will be able to prove all tautologies.
