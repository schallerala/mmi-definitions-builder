A Turing machine can be encoded with a binary word (once an encoding convention is chosen).
Similarly, words in all finite alphabets can be encoded by binary words (once a binary encoding of the alphabet symbols is chosen).
Therefore the universal language can be viewed as a language over a binary alphabet.
