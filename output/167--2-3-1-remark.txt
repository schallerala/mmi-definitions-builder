Let us stress the difference between "planar graph" and "plane graph".
A planar graph is an abstract graph that can be drawn in the plane.
A plane graph is a graph that is already drawn in the plane.
The reason for distinguishing between plane and planar is that different drawings can be possible.
As the above example shows there are different (non-isotopic) plane graphs which represent the same (isomorphic) planar graphs.
