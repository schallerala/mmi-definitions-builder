Here are the first few terms of the sequence $p_n$, starting with $p_0$ which we by definition set to be equal to $1$:
\[
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 15, 22, \ldots.
\]



Unlike for the money changing problem and for Fibonacci numbers, there is no closed formula for the number of partitions.
But there are a lot of beautiful theorems about partitions, and we will prove some of them.
Often we will be using the generating function method.
