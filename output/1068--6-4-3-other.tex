From any DFA one can construct the minimum DFA accepting the same language by merging certain sets of states into one state.
Two states $q_i$, $q_j$ must be merged if the corresponding sets $T_i$, $T_j$ are contained in the same equivalence class $S_k$.
That is, $q_i \sim q_j$ if for all $x \in \Sigma^*$ either both $\widehat{\delta}(q_i, x)$ and $\widehat{\delta}(q_j, x)$ belong to $F$ or both do not.

One can certify non-equivalence of two states by finding a word $x$ such that $\widehat{\delta}(q_i, x) \in F$ and $\widehat{\delta}(q_j, x) \notin F$
or vice versa.
The algorithm marks pairs of distinguishable states recursively.

At the very beginning one removes all inaccessible states.
Obviously, this does not change the accepted language.

Then one draws a table whose rows and columns are marked by the remaining states.
As initialization, one marks all pairs $(q_i,q_j)$ such that $q_i \in F$ and $q_j \notin F$ or vice versa.
At each of the following steps one goes through all pairs $(q_i,q_j)$, and for each of them one considers all alphabet letters $a$.
If the pair $(\delta(q_i,a), \delta(q_j,a))$ was marked at one of the previous steps, then one marks the pair $(q_i, q_j)$.
If at some step no new pairs are marked, then the algorithm stops.
All pairs of states which are unmarked are merged into a single state
(it is also possible that several states are merged into one state).
