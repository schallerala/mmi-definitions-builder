proof
Lay  stones in a row.
To form a composition of the number  we must separate these stones by  sticks.
The numbers of stones between consecutive sticks sum up to , thus form a composition of .
For example,

     5 = 1+3+1

In how many ways can we put  sticks between  stones?
There are  gaps, and we must choose  of them.
There are  ways to do this. The theorem is proved.
