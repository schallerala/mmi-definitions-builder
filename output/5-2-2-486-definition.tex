\begin{dfn}
Let $A(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k$ and $B(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty b_k x^k$ be two formal power series.
Their \emph{sum} is the formal power series
\[
A(x) + B(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty (a_k + b_k)x^k,
\]
and their \emph{product} is the formal power series
\[
A(x)B(x) = \sum_{k=0}^\infty c_k x^k,
\]
where
\[
c_k = a_0b_k + a_1b_{k-1} + \cdots + a_kb_0 = \sum_{i=0}^k a_i b_{k-i}.
\]
