\begin{proof}[First proof]
A regular language can be constructed from the basic languages $\emptyset$, $\{\epsilon\}$, $\{a\}$
by operations of union, concatenation and Kleene closure.
Therefore it suffices to show that the basic languages are context-free.
Each of them is generated by the grammars with a single variable $S$ and the following production sets:
\[
P = \emptyset \text{ for }L = \emptyset, \quad P = \{S \to \epsilon\} \text{ for }L = \{\epsilon\}, \quad P = \{S \to a\} \text{ for }L = \{a\}.
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{proof}[Second proof]
A regular language is accepted by some DFA.
Every DFA can be viewed as a PDA with stack playing no role and word acceptance by final states.
\end{proof}
