It follows that one can extract $q$-th root from any formal power series with non-zero constant term.

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:Vandermonde}]
Step 1. If $\alpha = m$ and $\beta = n$ are positive integers, then
\[
\binom{m + n}{k} = \sum_{i=0}^k \binom{m}{i} \binom{n}{k-i}
\]
can be proved by a combinatorial argument: $\binom{m+n}{k}$ is the number of different choices of $k$ elements from the set $\{1, \ldots, m+n\}$.
To choose $k$ elements, one has to choose $i$ elements among $\{1, \ldots, m\}$ and $k-i$ elements among $\{m+1, \ldots, m+n\}$ for some $i$ between $0$ and $k$.
The number of such choices is $\binom{m}{i} \binom{n}{k-i}$.
Summing over $i$ we obtain the desired formula.

Step 2. Let us prove
\[
\binom{\alpha + n}{k} = \sum_{i=0}^k \binom{\alpha}{i} \binom{n}{k-i}
\]
for all $\alpha \in \R$ and all positive integers $n$.
For fixed $n$ and $k$ the left hand side of the above formula is a polynomial in $\alpha$ of degree $k$;
the right hand side is also a polynomial in $\alpha$ of degree $k$.
Both polynomials take equal values at $\alpha = m$ for all positive integers $m$.
It follows that the polynomials are identical
(if two polynomials of degree $k$ coincide at $k+1$ points, then their difference is a polynomial of degree $\le k$ with $> k$ roots, hence identically zero).

Step 3. Finally let us prove
\[
\binom{\alpha + \beta}{k} = \sum_{i=0}^k \binom{\alpha}{i} \binom{\beta}{k-i}
\]
for all $\alpha, \beta \in \R$.
Fix $\alpha \in \R$ and $k \in \Z_{\ge 0}$. Then the left and the right hand sides are polynomials in $\beta$ of degree $k$.
By Step 2, the values of these polynomials coincide whenever $\beta$ is a positive integer.
Thus the polynomials are identically equal.
(In particular, evaluating the left hand side and the right hand side for any values of $\alpha, k, \beta$ leads to the same results.)
