proof
If  is a regular expression for , and  is a regular expression for ,
then the regular expression  describes the language , which is therefore regular.

Given regular expressions , , ,
it is very difficult to find regular expressions for the intersection  and the complement .
Let us approach the problem from a different direction.

Let  be a DFA accepting the language .
Then  accepts the language .
Indeed,

w ^* R w R (q_0, w) F
(q_0, w) Q F w L(M).

Therefore  is regular.

With the intersection we are helped by de Morgan's rule:

R_1 R_2 = R_1 R_2,

where the overline denotes the complement.
Since the operations applied on the right hand side preserve regularity, the intersection of two regular languages is regular.
