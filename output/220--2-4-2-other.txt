It follows that an -augmenting path can look only as the bottom path on Figure fig:AltPath.
In addition, there must be no edge of  incident to the initial and terminal vertices of the path.
See Figure fig:AugmPathDef.

An -augmenting path can be used to modify  to a bigger matching by "switching" the edges along the path.
This is illustrated in Figure fig:AugmPath.

The following theorem provides a basis to an algorithm for finding a maximum matching.
