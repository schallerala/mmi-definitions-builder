\subsection{Operations with formal power series}
\label{sec:OperFPS}
There are two ways of interpreting the calculations we made above.
The first approach is by viewing $x$ as a real number close to $0$ such that the power series $\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k$ converges.
Then some theorems from calculus ensure that all our operations were correct.
The second approach is to deal with $\sum_{k=0}^\infty a_k x^k$ as a formal expression,
to define operations with such expressions, and to show that these operations satisfy all of the usual algebraic properties.
We choose the second approach: \emph{formal power series}.
