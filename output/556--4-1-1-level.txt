First-order languages
The alphabet of the predicate logic consists of
itemize
variables;
function symbols;
predicate symbols;
logical connectives ;
auxiliary symbols  and ;
equality symbol .
itemize

Informally speaking (and as indicated in the introduction), a variable is an object,
a function is an operation with objects whose result is also an object,
and a predicate is a statement about one or several object (in other words, an operation with objects whose result is a truth value).

Compared to the propositional logic, we have two new logical connectives:
the universal quantifier  and the existential quantifier .

The equality symbol is not always included in the alphabet.
Accordingly, there are two slightly different versions of predicate logic: logic with equality and logic without equality.

Before stating the rules according to which the alphabet symbols can be combined one has to fix a signature.
This is a list of function symbols and predicate symbols together with the number of arguments for each of them.
