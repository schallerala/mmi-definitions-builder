proof
The equation  consists of an infinite sequence of equations
gather*
a_0b_0 = 1

a_0b_1 + a_1b_0 = 0

a_0b_2 + a_1b_1 + a_2b_0 = 0

with unknowns .
The first equation implies  (which is defined because ).
Knowing  we can express  from the second equation:

b_1 = -a_1b_0a_0

and continue in the same spirit, because -st equation can be solved for :

b_k = -1a_0_i=1^k a_ib_k-i.

This shows that the inverse series  exists and is unique.
proof

We denote the inverse series to  by  or .
