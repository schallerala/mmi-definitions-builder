\begin{proof}
By Lemma \ref{lem:FalsifyRoot}, a valuation $v$ satisfies $A$ if and only if it satisfies all leaves of the deduction tree.
The leaf $p_1, \ldots, p_k \vdash q_1, \ldots, q_l$ is satisfied if and only if
the disjunctive clause above is satisfied (see Definition \ref{dfn:FalsifySequent}).
Finally, $v$ satisfies all leaves if and only if it satisfies the conjunction of all these clauses.
\end{proof}

One constructs a DNF for $A$ in a similar way starting from the sequent~$A \vdash$.
