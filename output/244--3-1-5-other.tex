\begin{proof}
This follows from Theorem \ref{thm:BooleNF}.
Every formula represents a boolean function.
As we proved in Theorem \ref{thm:BooleNF}, every boolean function is represented by a formula in DNF.
Formulas representing the same function are logically equivalent.
\end{proof}

Similarly, a \emph{disjunctive clause} is a disjunction of several literals.
