Every spanning tree in a connected graph on $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges.
However, if edges are equipped with weights, then we can speak about the spanning tree of minimum total weight.
For example, if the weights of edges are the costs of building railroads between towns,
then the minimum spanning tree is the cheapest railroad network connecting all towns.
