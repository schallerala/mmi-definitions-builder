\begin{dfn}
A problem is called \emph{decidable} if the corresponding language is recursive,
that is if there is a Turing machine which halts on every input
and accepts exactly those words which correspond to problem instances with the positive answer.

A problem is called \emph{semi-decidable} if the corresponding language is recursively enumerable.
\end{dfn}
