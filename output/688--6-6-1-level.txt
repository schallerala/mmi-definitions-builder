Definition
A pushdown automaton is similar to a finite automaton:
it has a finite number of states and changes the state according to the input.
But it has additional memory, in the form of a stack of unbounded depth.
At every step the automaton reads the input symbol and the top symbol of the stack.
According to these data, the automaton changes its state and rewrites the top of the stack.

We proceed to a formal definition.
