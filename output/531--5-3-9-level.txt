An infinite (but fast convergent) series that computes  was found by Ramanujan and Hardy and later improved by Rademacher.
A consequences of the latter is the asymptotics for the number of partitions:

p_n 14n3 e^2n/3.

Ramanujan observed and later proved that

p_5n+4  is divisible by  5,

p_7n+5  is divisible by  7,

p_11n+6  is divisible by  11.

Erdos and Lehner proved that a "random" partition of  has  summands.

Both Ramanujan and Erdos were extraordinary figures.
