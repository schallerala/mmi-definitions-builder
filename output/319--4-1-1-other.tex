In particular, if $f$ is a nullary function, then $f()$ is a term.
We will usually omit the brackets in this situation.
This has one drawback: syntactically, a nullary function becomes indistinguishable from a variable.
(Later we will see that their semantics is different.)

For example, with a ternary function $f$, a binary function $g$, and a $0$-ary function $a$ one can compose the following terms:
\[
f(x, g(y,x), a), \quad g(f(x,y,a), g(x,z)).
\]
