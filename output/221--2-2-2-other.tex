\begin{proof}
Take a path $P \subset T$ of maximum length.
(If there are several paths of maximum length, take one of them.)
I claim that its endpoints $v$ and $w$ are leaves.
Indeed, assume $\deg v > 1$.
Then there is an edge of $T$ incident with $v$ and not belonging to $P$.
If the other end of this edge is also a vertex of $P$, then $T$ contains a cycle, which contradicts to it being a tree.
If the other end is not in $P$, then adding it to $P$ we obtain a longer path.
This contradicts the choice of $P$.
Thus the assumption $\deg v > 1$ was false, $v$ is a leaf, and $w$ is a leaf as well.
\end{proof}
