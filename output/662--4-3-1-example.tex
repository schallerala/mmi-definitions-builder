\label{exl:FirstGraphTheory}
The theory consisting of the following two sentences:
\begin{gather*}
\forall x (\neg P(x,x))\\
\forall x \forall y (P(x,y) \to P(y,x))
\end{gather*}
is called \emph{first-order graph theory}.
Any model of this theory is a graph:
the universe corresponds to the vertex set, and the predicate interpretation to the edge set.
