Write two rows of $1$ starting at the same place and going one downwards
to the left and the other downwards to the right. Then fill in this
frame row after row according to the rule that every number is equal to
the sum of its top-left and top-right neighbors.

One adopts the convention that the rows of the Pascal triangle as well
as the numbers in each row are numbered starting from $0$. Thus the row
number $n$ contains $n+1$ entries numbered with $0$ up to $n$.
