Modifications of Turing machines
There are several variations of Turing machines, e. g.:
itemize
multi-tape: several tapes, each with its own head for reading and writing;
multidimensional: a square grid instead of a tape, the head can move not only left and right, but also up and down;
non-deterministic.
itemize
Although they seem more powerful, each of them can be simulated by an ordinary Turing machine.
