\subsection{Finite automata with epsilon-transitions}
This is a further extension of the concept of a finite automaton.
In addition to ``branching'' and ``emergency stops'' present in $NFA$
we allow spontaneous transitions between some states.
That is, the transition diagram may contain arrows marked by $\epsilon$, the empty word.
Spontaneous transitions may branch as well: there might be several $\epsilon$-arrows starting from the same state.

Here is a formal definition.
