\begin{proof}
Induction on the number of connectives.

A sequent without connectives consists of proposition symbols.
Assume that every sequent with $< n$ connectives is the root of a closed tree.
Take any sequent $S$ with $n$ connectives, choose the outermost connective in any of its propositions and eliminate it.
This produces a small tree with $S$ at the root.
In every inference rule, each of the premises contains less connectives than the conclusion.
Thus by induction assumption the leaves of our small tree are roots of closed deduction trees.
Together, this produces a closed deduction tree with $S$ at the root.
\end{proof}
