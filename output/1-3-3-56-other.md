*Proof.* We know that $\binom{n}{k}$ is the number of binary words of
length $n$ with exactly $k$ digits $1$. There are two kinds of words
like that: those that start with $1$ and those that start with $0$. How
many words of each kind are there?

When we delete the first digit, we are left with a word of length $n-1$.
For the words of the first kind, this word of length $n-1$ must contain
$k-1$ digits $1$. Thus there are $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ words of the first
kind.

Similarly, for a word of second kind we are left with a word of length
$n-1$ that contains $k$ digits $1$. Thus there are $\binom{n-1}k$ words
of the second kind.

Since every word is either of the first kind or of the second kind but
not both, identity
[\[eqn:BinCoeffRec\]](#eqn:BinCoeffRec){reference-type="eqref"
reference="eqn:BinCoeffRec"} holds. ◻

*Proof of Theorem
[\[thm:BinPascal\]](#thm:BinPascal){reference-type="ref"
reference="thm:BinPascal"}.* Let us write the numbers $\binom{n}{k}$ in
a triangle similar to the Pascal triangle:

                                                                       $\binom{1}{0}$                    $\binom{1}{1}$

                                     $\binom{3}{0}$                    $\binom{3}{1}$                    $\binom{3}{2}$                    $\binom{3}{3}$

   $\binom{5}{0}$                    $\binom{5}{1}$                    $\binom{5}{2}$                    $\binom{5}{3}$                    $\binom{5}{4}$                    $\binom{5}{5}$

The top-left neighbor of the number $\binom{n}{k}$ is
$\binom{n-1}{k-1}$, the top-right neighbor is $\binom{n-1}{k}$. By Lemma
[\[lem:BinCoeffRec\]](#lem:BinCoeffRec){reference-type="ref"
reference="lem:BinCoeffRec"}, the numbers in the $\binom{n}{k}$-triangle
satisfy the same rule that the numbers in the Pascal triangle: each
number is the sum of its top-left and top-right neighbors. The outermost
numbers $\binom{n}{0}$ and $\binom{n}{n}$ are also the same as in the
Pascal triangle: $$\binom{n}{0} = \binom{n}{n} = 1.$$ It follows that
the $\binom{n}{k}$-triangle coincides with the Pascal triangle. (The
formal argument here is proof by induction: if the $n$-th line of the
$\binom{n}{k}$-triangle coincides with the $n$-th line of the Pascal
triangle, then their $(n+1)$-st lines also coincide.) ◻
