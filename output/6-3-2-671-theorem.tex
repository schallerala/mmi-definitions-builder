\begin{thm}[Pumping lemma for regular languages]
Let $L$ be a regular language.
Then there is an integer $n$ such that for any word $z \in L$ of length $|z| \ge n$ the word $z$ can be represented as $z = uvw$ in such a way that
\[
|uv| \le n, \quad |v| \ge 1, \quad \text{ and for all }k \ge 0 \text{ one has } uv^kw \in L.
\]
\end{thm}
