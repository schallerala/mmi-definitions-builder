proof
Let  be a propositional formula.
By Corollary cor:DNF the negation of  is equivalent to some formula in DNF:

A _= 1^N B_, B_= C_,1 C_,k_, C_,i  literals.

By De Morgan's law we have

A A _= 1^N B__= 1^N B__= 1^N (C_,1 C_,k_).

The negation of a literal is a negated or a doubly negated symbol.
Double negations can be removed, and we obtain a formula in CNF.
proof

An unsatisfiable formula is equivalent to .
This formula is at the same time in DNF (it is a single conjunctive clause) and in CNF (it is a conjunction of two disjunctive clauses).
A tautology is equivalent to , which is also in DNF and in CNF.
