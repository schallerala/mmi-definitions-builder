proof[Idea of the proof]
Introduce two new states: a final state  and a new initial state , and also a new start symbol .
As the first step, the automaton  puts the old start symbol  on the top of the new start symbol and goes to the old initial state:

(q'_0, , X_0) = (q_0, Z_0X_0).

Then one lets the old PDA  do its job.
If one sees  on the top of the stack, then it means that  has emptied its stack.
One then goes to the final state:

(q, , X_0) = (q_f, )  for all q q'_0.
