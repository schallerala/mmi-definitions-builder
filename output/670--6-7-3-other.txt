proof
Consider the languages
gather*
L = a^ib^ic^i i 1,

L_1 = a^ib^ic^j i, j 1,

L_2 = a^ib^jc^j i, j 1.
gather*
We have .
As we know,  is not context-free.
On the other hand  is generated by the grammar

S AB, A aAb ab, B cB c.

The language  is generated by a similar grammar.
Thus  and  are context-free languages whose intersection is not context-free.
