The transition from one configuration to another is denoted by the symbol $\specialvdash{M}{}$.
By definition of the transition function one has
\[
(q, aw, Z\alpha) \specialvdash{M}{} (p, w, \beta\alpha) \Leftrightarrow (p, \beta) \in \delta(q, a, Z),
\]
where $a \in \Sigma \cup \{\epsilon\}$.

We write $I \specialvdash{M}{*} J$ if for some $I_1, \ldots, I_n$ one has
\[
I \specialvdash{M}{} I_1 \specialvdash{M}{} I_2 \specialvdash{M}{} \cdots \specialvdash{M}{} I_n \specialvdash{M}{} J.
\]

In these terms, the acceptance criteria by final state and by empty stack are formulated as follows.
