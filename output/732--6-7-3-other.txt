proof
We know that CFL's are closed under union.
If they would be closed under complementation, then due to

L_1 L_2 = L_1 L_2

they would also be closed under intersection, which is not the case.
proof

The above argument is non-constructive.
Applied to the languages , ,  from the proof of Theorem thm:CFLIntClosed it says that at least one of the following is true:
enumerate
 is context-free, but  is not;
 is context-free, but  is not;
 is context free, but its complement is not.
enumerate
