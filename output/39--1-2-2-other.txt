proof
Let . With every subset  we associate a map  (the indicator function of ) defined as

1_A(x) =
cases
1, &if  x A,

0, &if  x A.
cases

One can show that  is a bijection between the set of all subsets and the set of all maps :
different subsets define different maps and every map  is the indicator function of the subset .

The number of all maps  is  by Theorem thm:AllMaps.
By the bijection principle, the number of all subsets of  is the same.
