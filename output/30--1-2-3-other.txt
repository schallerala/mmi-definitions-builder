proof
Without loss of generality, .
We have  possibilities to choose .
After this, for  there remain  possibilities, then  possibilities for ,
and so on up to , for which  possibilities remain.

The above argument works for , but the formula is true for  as well:
there are no injective maps in this case, and the product  vanishes because it contains a zero factor.
