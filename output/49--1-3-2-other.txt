proof
A monotone path can be encoded by a binary word,
where  stands for "a step to the right" and  stands for "a step upwards".
In order to attain the point , we need to make  steps to the right and  steps upwards.
Therefore the monotone paths from  to  correspond to words of length 
containing exactly  digits .
From Theorem thm:BinWordsK we know that the number of such words is .
