\begin{proof}
Let $X$ be the set of all possible ordered choices of $k$ balls out of $n$,
and $Y$ be the set of all unordered choices of $k$ balls.
There is a map $f \colon X \to Y$ (the ``forgetful map'') that associates to
an ordered collection of $k$ balls the same set of balls, but unordered.
(The balls lying in a line are put into another bag.)

For $y \in Y$, what is the cardinality of its preimage $f^{-1}(y)$?
This is the number of ways to order an unordered set of $k$ balls.
An ordering is a bijection to the set $\{1, 2, \ldots, k\}$, and from Corollary \ref{cor:NumberOfBijections} we know that there are $k!$ of them.
Therefore by the quotient rule we have
\[
|Y| = \frac{|X|}{k!} = \frac{n(n-1)\cdot \ldots \cdot (n-k+1)}{k!}.
\]
\end{proof}

As we already said, an unordered choice of $k$ balls out of $n$ is also called a $k$-combination.
Yet another name of this is a \emph{$k$-element subset} of a given $n$-element set.
(By definition, a set is an unordered collection of elements.)

\smallskip

\noindent\textbf{Notation.}
The number of $k$-element subsets of an $n$-element set is denoted by $\binom{n}{k}$
(pronounced ``$n$ choose $k$'').
