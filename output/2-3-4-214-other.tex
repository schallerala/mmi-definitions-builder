The faces of the dual graph $G^*$ correspond to the vertices of $G$:
the duals of the edges incident to $v \in V(G)$ form a cycle around $v$.
Thus we have bijections
\[
V(G) \mapsto F(G^*), \quad E(G) \mapsto E(G^*), \quad F(G) \mapsto V(G^*).
\]

Observe that Theorem \ref{thm:DualHandshake} is equivalent to the handshake lemma for the dual graph $G^*$.

Finally, note that the dual of $G^*$ is $G$ again:
\[
(G^*)^* = G.
\]
