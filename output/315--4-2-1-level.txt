Proof theory
We will present Gentzen's sequent calculus for predicate logic.
There are other proof theories, for example Hilbert-style systems.
These theories are equivalent to each other, which means that a formula provable within one of them is also provable within any other.
(Postfactum it follows from their soundness and completeness,
but one can describe a transformation of Hilbert proof into a Gentzen proof and vice versa in a direct way.)


Substitutions
Let  be a predicate formula, and let  be a term.
Assume that  contains a free variable .
Then we can define a new formula  obtained by substitution of  for all free occurrences of .
(We don't exclude the possibility that  also occurs bound in .)

Intuitively,  should represent a special case of , so that for example if  is true for all , then  is valid.
However, some substitutions do not have this property.
Take for example

A = y (y < x), t = y.

Then we have .
This is false in the universe of integers, although  was true.
