\begin{proof}
Let $G = (X \cup Y, E)$ be a $k$-regular bipartite graph.
Since every edge is incident to exactly one vertex from $X$, and every vertex is incident to exactly $k$ edges, we have $|E| = k|X|$.
Similarly, $|E| = k|Y|$. Thus we have $|X| = |Y|$.

Let us show that $k$-regularity implies condition \eqref{eqn:Hall}.
Take any $S \subset X$ and consider the bipartite graph $G' = (S \cup N(S), E')$, where $E'$ is the set of all edges incident to a vertex from $S$.
By the above argument, $|E'| = k|S|$.
On the other hand, for every $v \in N(S)$ we have $\deg_{G'} v \le k$, which implies $|E'| \le k|N(S)|$.
It follows that
\[
|N(S)| \ge \frac{|E'|}{k} = |S|,
\]
and we are done.
\end{proof}
