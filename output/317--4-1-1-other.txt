One can use the same set  of variables in all signatures.
This is a countably infinite set; we use the letters , , ,  etc. to denote its elements.
As function symbols we will use , , , 
and as predicate symbols , , , .


The strange word arity describes the number of arguments: a function or a predicate can be unary, binary, -ary, and even nullary.
The arity can be indicated by the number of dots (or other placeholders) between the brackets.
Below is an example of a signature.
center
tabularll
 & one unary function symbol

 & one binary and one unary predicate symbol
tabular
center
Nullary functions and nullary predicates have no arguments.
