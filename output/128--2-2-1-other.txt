proof
Take any two vertices of a tree.
Since a tree is connected, there is at least one path between these two vertices.
If there is more than one path, then this implies the existence of a cycle.
Namely, take the first vertex where the two paths diverge and the first vertex where they meet again;
the union of the segments of our paths between these vertices will be a cycle.
(We are not working out the details here.)
This contradicts the assumption that our graph is a tree, thus there cannot be more than one path between two vertices.
proof

A rooted tree is a tree  with a specified vertex , called the root of .
The edges of a tree can be equipped with orientation so that for every vertex  the (unique) path from  to  always follows the directions of edges.
(Again, this looks intuitively clear, but requires a formal proof.)
See Figure fig:RootedTreeOrient for an example.
