The generating function for partitions into distinct parts is

(1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3)
The generating function for partitions into odd parts is

(1+x+x^2+)(1+x^3+x^6+)(1+x^5+x^10+)= 11-x 11-x^3 11-x^5 
Let us show that the first formal power series is equal to the second one.
equation
eqn:OddDist
(1+x)(1+x^2)(1+x^3)= 1-x^21-x 1-x^41-x^2 1-x^61-x^3 = 11-x 11-x^3 11-x^5 equation
This equation is a bit more subtle than it appears.
We have

(1+x) (1+x^2k) = 1-x^21-x 1-x^4k1-x^2k = (1-x^2k+2) (1-x^4k)(1-x) (1-x^2k-1)

The right hand side has the same coefficient at  for  as the infinite product on the right hand side of eqn:OddDist.
And the left hand side has the same coefficient at  for  as the infinite product on the left hand side of eqn:OddDist.

proof[Bijective proof]
Take a partition of  into odd parts:

n = 1 m_1 + 3 m_3 + 5 m_5 + 
It can be transformed into a partition into distinct parts as follows.
Write  in the binary system:

m_2k+1 = 2^d_1 + + 2^d_s, d_i d_j.

Then replace  by

(2k+1)(2^d_1 + + 2^d_s) = 2^d_1(2k+1) + + 2^d_s(2k+1).

Being done for all , this gives a new partition of .
The parts of the new partition are different.
Indeed, any two parts that come from the same  are distinct:  because .
Any two parts that come from different  are also distinct: 
because they have different greatest odd divisors .

In the opposite direction, we transform every partition of  into distinct parts as follows:
multline*
n = k_1 + + k_t, k_i k_j

= o_1 2^d_1 + + o_t 2^d_t, o_i  odd

= 1 m_1 + 3 m_3 + , m_2k+1 = _o_i = 2k+1 2^d_i
multline*
It can easily be shown that this transformation is inverse to the first one.
Thus we have a bijection between partitions into odd and partitions into distinct parts.
