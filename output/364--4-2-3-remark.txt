rem
It is important to work in a breadth-first way, otherwise one can obtain an infinite tree for a valid formula.
This happens, for example, in the following deduction tree for the formula :
prooftree






prooftree
Here we are neglecting the non-atomic formula  and working with  only,
which produces an infinite path from Example exl:CounterexampleInfinite.
Constructed in a breadth-first way, this tree will close with an axiom leaf with  on both sides of .
