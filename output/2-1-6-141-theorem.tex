\begin{thm}
A graph is Eulerian if and only if all of its vertex degrees are even
and all vertices of positive degree belong to the same connected component.
A graph is semi-Eulerian if and only if it has exactly two vertices of odd degree
and all vertices of positive degree belong to the same connected component.
