proof
Let  be an -NFA.
Construct a DFA  by putting

q'_0 = q_0, F' = P Q P F ,

and defining the transition function by

a) = (P, a).

We claim that for any word  holds
equation
eqn:DeltaD=DeltaE
w) = (q_0, w),
equation
where  and  are the extended transition functions of  and .
This is proved by induction on the length of the word .
The base: , that is . We have

) = q'_0 = q_0 = (q_0, ).

The induction step: assume eqn:DeltaD=DeltaE holds for all words of length .
Any word of length  has the form , where  and .
Using the induction hypothesis, we obtain

wa) = w), a) = (q_0, w), a)
= ((q_0, w), a) = (q_0, wa).


Now, by definition we have
gather*
w L(M) (q_0, w) F ,

w L(M') w) F' w) F ,
gather*
which implies  due to eqn:DeltaD=DeltaE.
