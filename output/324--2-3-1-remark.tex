\begin{rem}
Let us stress the difference between ``planar graph'' and ``plane graph''.
A planar graph is an abstract graph that \emph{can be} drawn in the plane.
A plane graph is a graph that \emph{is} already drawn in the plane.
The reason for distinguishing between plane and planar is that different drawings can be possible.
As the above example shows there are different (non-isotopic) plane graphs which represent the same (isomorphic) planar graphs.
