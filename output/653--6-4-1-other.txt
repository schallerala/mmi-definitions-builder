proof
The reflexivity and the symmetry are obvious.
To prove the transitivity, let , , and assume that .
Then there is a distinguishing extension  for  and .
Without loss of generality, , .
Then if , we have , and if , we have .
proof

An equivalence relation splits the set  of all words into equivalence classes:
equation
eqn:SigmaEqClasses
^* = S_0 S_1 S_2 equation
where  if and only if  and  belong to the same class.
As we noticed in Example exl:LEquiv, if , then either  or .
It follows that every class  is either contained in  or disjoint from .
