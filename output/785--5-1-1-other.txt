At the first sight it is not clear at all that this formula produces a rational and even integer number.

A direct consequence of the Binet formula is that the Fibonacci sequence grows as a geometric progression with ratio
equal to the golden ratio

= 1+52 = 1,618.

Indeed, the second summand is

(1-52)^n = (-0,618)^n 0  as  n ,

which implies that

a_n ^n5,

and even more exactly

a_n = ^n5 ,

where  denotes the closest integer to the number .
