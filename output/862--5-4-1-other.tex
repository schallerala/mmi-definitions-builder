\begin{proof}
Take a binary tree with $n+2$ leaves and remove its root.
This splits the tree into two parts: the left subtree and the right subtree, see Figure~\ref{fig:InductionCatalanTrees}.
Each of them is either a full binary tree or a single vertex.
If the left subtree contains $k+1$ leaves, then the right subtree contains $n-k+1$ leaves
(if the subtree has only one vertex, then the number of leaves is one).
For every $k$, there are $c_k$ possible left subtrees and $c_{n-k}$ possible right subtrees.
This leads to the formula.
\end{proof}
