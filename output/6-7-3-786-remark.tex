\begin{rem}
The situation is similar to the following proof of the existence of two irrational numbers $\alpha$ and $\beta$ such that $\alpha^\beta$ is rational.
If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational, then one may take $\alpha = \beta = \sqrt{2}$.
If $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is irrational, then one may take $\alpha = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$, $\beta = \sqrt{2}$ because of
\[
\left(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\right)^{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2} \cdot \sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}^2 = 2.
\]
(In fact, $\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}$ is rational, which follows from a more general (and more complicated) theorem by Gelfond and Schneider from 1934.)
