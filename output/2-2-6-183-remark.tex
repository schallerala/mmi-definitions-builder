\begin{rem}
There are other algorithms that find a minimum spanning tree, for example Prim's algorithm.
Closely related to Kruskal's algorithm is the \emph{reverse-delete algorithm}.
Here we order the edges in the nonincreasing order of weights, go through the list
and delete an edge if this does not disconnect the graph.
