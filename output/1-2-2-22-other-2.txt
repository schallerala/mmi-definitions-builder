Let . With every subset  we associate a map  (the indicator function of ) defined as







One can show that  is a bijection between the set of all subsets and the set of all maps :
different subsets define different maps and every map  is the indicator function of the subset .




The number of all maps  is  by Theorem .
By the bijection principle, the number of all subsets of  is the same.



The set of all maps  is sometimes denoted by , so that Theorem  can be formulated as .
This is not the only reason for the notation .
One can show that  for disjoint  and , and .

Also, the Cartesian power



can be viewed as the set :
a sequence  corresponds to a map , .
