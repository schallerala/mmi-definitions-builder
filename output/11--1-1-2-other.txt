Up to now we have considered independent choices,
when the result of one choice does not influence the sets of subsequent choices.
However, it is not the set of choices what matters, but rather the number of choices.
This leads us to the general product rule:
center
.9If two consecutive choices are made, with  possibilities for the first choice and  possibilities for the second choice,
then the number of all possible outcomes is equal to .
center
Of course, this can be generalized to several consecutive choices
if the number of possibilities for each choice is independent of the results of all previous choices.
