proof
Make the balls of the same color distinguishable (by writing on them numbers, for example).
Then all  balls can be arranged in  different ways.
Now apply the quotient rule.
There is a forgetful map from the set  of arrangements with balls of the same color distinguishable
to the set  of arrangements where balls of the same color are undistinguishable.
What is the multiplicity of this map, that is the cardinalities of the preimages ?
The balls of the -th color can be permuted amongst themselves in  different ways.
Permutations within every color can be performed independently, which gives us  elements in 
all of which correspond to the same element in .
Thus we have , and hence

Y = Xk_1! k_m! = n!k_1! k_m!.
