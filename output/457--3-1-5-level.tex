\subsection{Disjunctive and conjunctive normal forms}
Propositional formulas that we obtained in Theorem \ref{thm:BooleNF} have a very special form:
they are disjunction of conjunctions of (possibly negated) proposition symbols.

Let us fix some terminology.
A \emph{literal} is a proposition symbol or its negation.
A \emph{conjunctive clause} is a conjunction of one or several literals.
