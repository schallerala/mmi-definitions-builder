\begin{proof}
By Theorem \ref{thm:AllSubsets}, an $n$-element set has $2^n$ subsets.
By definition, $\binom{n}{k}$ is the number of $k$-element subsets.
(One may say that we are using the sum rule here: the set of all subsets is a disjoint union of sets of $k$-element subsets over all $k$ from $0$ to $n$.)
\end{proof}
