In particular, if  is a nullary function, then  is a term.
We will usually omit the brackets in this situation.
This has one drawback: syntactically, a nullary function becomes indistinguishable from a variable.
(Later we will see that their semantics is different.)

For example, with a ternary function , a binary function , and a -ary function  one can compose the following terms:

f(x, g(y,x), a), g(f(x,y,a), g(x,z)).
