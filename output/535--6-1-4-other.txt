In other words,  is  together with all states that can be reached from  by sequences of -transitions.

Let us modify and extend the transition function so that it will tell us what states are accessible from a given state
for a given input.
enumerate


enumerate
(Note that  is a set, so that  denotes
the union of  over all .)

Observe that, contrarily to the case of DFA and NFA, , but rather

(q,a) = (q, a) (q,a).

It is not hard to see that  consists of all states reachable from  on the input 
with arbitrarily many -transitions before , in the middle of , and after .

In terms of the extended transition function the language accepted by an -NFA is defined as follows.
