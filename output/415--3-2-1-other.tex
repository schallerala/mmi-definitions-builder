\subsection{Deductive systems}
A proof theory is a method of establishing the validity of a proposition (that is whether a given proposition is a tautology).
There is a type of proof theories called deductive systems.
A deductive system consists of
\begin{itemize}
\item a set of propositional formulas called \emph{axioms};
\item a set of inference rules.
\end{itemize}

An inference rule has the form $\Gamma \vdash A$, where $A$ is a proposition and $\Gamma$ is a set of propositions.
It is convenient to write an axiom $A$ in the form $\vdash A$.
This allows to define provable propositions recursively.
