\begin{proof}
Both statements are proved by contraposition.
That is, we prove the following: if $G$ contains no cycle, then $|E| \le |V| - 1$; if $G$ is connected, then $|E| \ge |V| - 1$.

Let $G$ be acyclic.
Then by Corollary \ref{cor:ForestEdges} it has $|V| - k \le |V| - 1$ edges, where $k$ is the number of components of $G$.

Let $G$ be connected.
By Theorem \ref{thm:SpanTree}, $G$ has a spanning tree which, by Theorem \ref{thm:TreeEdges}, has $|V| - 1$ edges.
Thus $G$ has at least $|V| - 1$ edges.
\end{proof}
