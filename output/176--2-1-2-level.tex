\subsection{Some graphs known by names}
Below are some important families of graphs.
\begin{itemize}
\item
The \emph{complete graph} $K_n$ is a graph with $n$ vertices, with each pair of vertices joined by an edge.
\item
The \emph{cycle graph} $C_n$ is a graph with $n$ vertices $v_1, \cdots, v_n$ and the edges $\{v_i, v_{i+1}\}$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n-1$ and $\{v_1, v_n\}$.
\item
The \emph{path graph} $P_n$ is a graph with $n$ vertices $v_1, \cdots, v_n$ and the edges $\{v_i, v_{i+1}\}$ for $i = 1, \ldots, n-1$.
\end{itemize}
