In order to describe formally what it means that a word can be derived from the start symbol, let us fix some notations and terminology.
If  is any production in , and ,
then we write 
and say that  directly derives  in grammar .
If  are such that

_1 [G] _2, _2 [G] _3, , _n-1 [G] _n,

then we write  and say that  derives  in .
When it is clear which grammar we use, then we omit  and write  and , respectively.

Now we can describe the language generated by  as

L(G) = w T^* S [G]* w.

A language is called a context-free language (CFL) if it is generated by some context-free grammar.
