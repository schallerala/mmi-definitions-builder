\begin{exl}
A restaurant offers a choice of $3$ first courses, $4$ main courses, and $5$ desserts.
How many different full course dinners are there?

A full course dinner is an element of the Cartesian product
\[
\{\text{first courses}\} \times \{\text{main courses}\} \times \{\text{desserts}\}.
\]
Multiplying the cardinalities of these sets we obtain the answer: $3 \cdot 4 \cdot 5 = 60$ different full course dinners are possible.
