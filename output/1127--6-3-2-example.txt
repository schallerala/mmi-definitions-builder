Take the alphabet of one symbol 
and consider the language :
all sequences of 's whose length is a perfect square.
Let us show that  is not regular. Assume the contrary, and let  be the integer in the pumping lemma.
Let . By the pumping lemma, , where , and  for all .
For  one has , thus .
This contradiction shows that our assumption was false, and  is not regular.
