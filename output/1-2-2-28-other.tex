\begin{proof}
One can argue by the product rule again.
Or, one can establish a bijection between the set of binary sequences and the set of outcomes when tossing a coin:
one encodes an outcome by putting $1$ for ``heads'' and $0$ for ``tails''.
It is easy to see that this is a bijection, thus by the previous theorem the number of binary sequences is $2^n$.
\end{proof}
