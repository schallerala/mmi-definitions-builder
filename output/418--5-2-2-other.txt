The composition is not always well-defined. Indeed, we have

A(B(x)) = a_0 + a_1(b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + ) + a_2(b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + )^2 + .

In particular, the constant term is an infinite sum , which is not good.
However, if , then we have

a_k (B(x))^k = a_k (b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + )^k = a_k b_1^k x^k +  higher order terms,

so that the coefficient at  in  is a finite expression in .
Thus we arrive to the following conclusion.
