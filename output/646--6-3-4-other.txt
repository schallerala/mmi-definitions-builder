proof
Let  be a regular language, and  a homomorphism.
Let  be a DFA accepting .
We will construct a DFA accepting  thus proving that this language is regular.
The idea is to use the same set of states and the same set of final states, but interpret each symbol  as .
Then a word  will be accepted by the new automaton if and only if  was accepted by the old one.
Formally, put

M' = (Q, , q_0, F),  where a) = (q, h(a)).

It can be shown by induction on the length of a word  that .
Thus we have

w L(M') w) F (q, h(w)) F h(w) L
w h^-1(L),

which means .
