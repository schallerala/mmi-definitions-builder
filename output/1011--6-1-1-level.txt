Alphabets, words, and languages
An alphabet is any finite set of symbols.
Examples:

the binary alphabet ;
the alphabet of a single symbol ;
the alphabet  of the propositional logic.

A string or a word is a finite sequence of symbols from a given alphabet.
The set of words of length  in the alphabet  is denoted by :

^n = x_1 x_n x_i  i.

This is the same as the Cartesian power , with only a notational difference: 
instead of .

The concatenation of two words defines a map .
Clearly,  in general.
Denote by  the set of all words in the alphabet .

There is a unique element in : the word of zero length; it is denoted by .
One has

w = w = w for all  w ^*.


A language is a subset of .
Here are some examples of languages.

itemize
The set of all sequences of zeros of prime length:

0^p p  is a prime number.

The set of all binary palindromes (binary sequences that read the same forward and backward):

, 0, 1, 00, 11, 000, 010, .

In the alphabet of propositional logic, the set of all propositional formulas.
In the same alphabet, the set of all propositional formulas which are tautologies.
