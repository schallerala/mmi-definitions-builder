We don't give the proof, which is similar to the case of sequences of order 2.
If all roots of  are distinct, then the coefficients  in

a_n = c_1 _1^n + + c_k _k^n

are found by solving a system of  linear equations with  unknowns.
If there are multiple roots, some work should be done in order to prove that the sequences  satisfy
the recursive relation eqn:LinReck.
