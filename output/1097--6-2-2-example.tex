\begin{exl}
Construct an automaton accepting the language $01^* + 1$.

The automaton obtained with the above argument has ten states, see Example 2.12 from the first edition of Hopcroft-Ullman.
One can rather easily construct an $\epsilon$-NFA with three states.
The above algorithm aims not for the smallest number of states, but for the simplicity of the construction.
