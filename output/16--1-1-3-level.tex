\subsection{Difference rule}
The set difference: $X \setminus Y = \{x \in X \mid x \notin Y\}$.
\[
\text{If }X \supset Y, \text{ then } |X \setminus Y| = |X| - |Y|.
\]
Instead of counting the number of ``good'' outcomes,
one can count the number of ``bad'' ones and subtract it from the total number of outcomes.
