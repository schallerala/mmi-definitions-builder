\begin{proof}
We have an algorithm which converts a regular expression into a finite automaton.
Therefore it suffices to find an algorithm for the equivalence of finite automata.

Given two finite automata $M_1$ and $M_2$, let $L_1 = L(M_1)$ and $L_2 = L(M_2)$.
By Theorem \ref{thm:ClosRegLang}, the symmetric difference
\[
L_1 \triangle L_2 = (L_1 \setminus L_2) \cup (L_2 \setminus L_1)
\]
is a regular language.
Thus there is a finite automaton $M$ that accepts the language $L_1 \triangle L_2$.
One has
\[
L_1 = L_2 \Leftrightarrow L_1 \triangle L_2 = \emptyset.
\]
Therefore it suffices to decide whether the language accepted by $M$ is empty.
The language is empty if and only if from the initial state no final state can be reached.
This is easy to check algorithmically.
