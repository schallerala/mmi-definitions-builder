We don't give the proof, which is similar to the case of sequences of order 2.
If all roots of $P(x)$ are distinct, then the coefficients $c_i$ in
\[
a_n = c_1 \lambda_1^n + \cdots + c_k \lambda_k^n
\]
are found by solving a system of $k$ linear equations with $k$ unknowns.
If there are multiple roots, some work should be done in order to prove that the sequences $n^j \lambda_i^n$ satisfy
the recursive relation \eqref{eqn:LinReck}.
