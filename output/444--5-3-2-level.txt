Compositions again
Recall that a weak composition of a number  is a representation of  as a sum of non-negative integers.
(One counts ordered sums:  and  are different compositions.)
We have computed the number of weak compositions in Section sec:Comp by the "stones and sticks" method.
Let us do it again with generating functions.

Fix a positive integer  and denote by  the number of weak compositions of  from  parts.
