\begin{proof}
Proof by contradiction.
Assume that there is a model $M$ of $T$ which does not satisfy $A$.
Then this model falsifies the sequent $\Gamma \vdash A$, and therefore falsifies one of the leaves of the deduction tree.
But this is impossible, thus every model that satisfies $T$ also satisfies $A$.
\end{proof}
