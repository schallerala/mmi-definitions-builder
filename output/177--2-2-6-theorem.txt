thm[Kruskal's algorithm]
Order the edges of a weighted connected graph according to their weights:

(e_1, , e_m) such that (e_1) (e_m).

Going through this list, mark an edge if it does not create a cycle together with the previously marked edges.
More exactly, put : the graph with isolated vertices only.
If  is already defined, then put

G_i+1 =
cases
G_i + e_i+1 & if  G_i + e_i+1  has no cycles

G_i & otherwise.
cases

The output of the algorithm is the graph .
