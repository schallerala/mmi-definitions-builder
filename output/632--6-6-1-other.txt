At the beginning, the automaton is in the state , and the stack contains the symbol .

The transition function  takes three arguments:
the current state of the automaton, an input symbol or , and the top symbol of the stack.
The value of the transition function

(q, a, Z) = (p_1, _1), , (p_m, _m), _i ^*,

is interpreted as follows.
If the automaton in the state  reads the input symbol  and sees the symbol  on the top of the stack,
then, for a random , it enters the state  and replaces the symbol  by the string .
