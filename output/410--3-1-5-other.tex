\begin{proof}
Let $A$ be a propositional formula.
By Corollary \ref{cor:DNF} the negation of $A$ is equivalent to some formula in DNF:
\[
\neg A \simeq \bigvee_{\alpha = 1}^N B_\alpha, \quad B_\alpha = C_{\alpha,1} \wedge \cdots \wedge C_{\alpha,k_{\alpha}}, \quad C_{\alpha,i} \text{ literals}.
\]
By De Morgan's law we have
\[
A \simeq \neg\neg A \simeq \neg \bigvee_{\alpha = 1}^N B_\alpha \simeq \bigwedge_{\alpha = 1}^N \neg B_\alpha
\simeq \bigwedge_{\alpha = 1}^N (\neg C_{\alpha,1} \vee \cdots \vee \neg C_{\alpha,k_{\alpha}}).
\]
The negation of a literal is a negated or a doubly negated symbol.
Double negations can be removed, and we obtain a formula in CNF.
\end{proof}

An unsatisfiable formula is equivalent to $p \wedge \neg p$.
This formula is at the same time in DNF (it is a single conjunctive clause) and in CNF (it is a conjunction of two disjunctive clauses).
A tautology is equivalent to $p \vee \neg p$, which is also in DNF and in CNF.
