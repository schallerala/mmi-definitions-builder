proof
Let  be the set of permutations  such that .
Then  is the set of all non-derangements, permutations with at least one fixed points.
Calculate its cardinality by the inclusion-exclusion formula.
The intersection  consists of all permutations satisfying the conditions

f(i_1) = i_1, , f(i_k) = i_k.

The number of such permutations is 
(to determine , it remains to map bijectively an -element set to an -element set).
Thus we have

A_i_1 A_i_k = (n-k)!

for any choice of  sets out of .
Since the number of such choices is , we have

A_1 A_n = n (n-1)! - n2 (n-2)! + + (-1)^n-1 nn 0!.

To count the derangements, we subtract the number of non-derangements from the number of all permutations,
which leads to the formula in the theorem.
proof

Now we can compute the probability that no guest gets his hat:

derangementspermutations = _k=0^n (-1)^k n!k!n! = _k=0^n (-1)^kk!.

Recall that

_k=0^x^kk! = e^x.

It follows that the above probability converges to .
