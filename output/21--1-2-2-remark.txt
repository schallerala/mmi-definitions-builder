The set of all maps  is sometimes denoted by , so that Theorem thm:AllMaps can be formulated as .
This is not the only reason for the notation .
One can show that  for disjoint  and , and .

Also, the Cartesian power

X^n = X X_n = (x_1, , x_n) x_i X  for all i

can be viewed as the set :
a sequence  corresponds to a map , .
