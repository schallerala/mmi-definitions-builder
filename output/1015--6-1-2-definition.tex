\begin{dfn}
A \emph{deterministic finite automaton (DFA)} is a quintuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where
\begin{itemize}
\item
$Q$ is the set of states;
\item
$\Sigma$ is the input alphabet;
\item
$\delta$ is the transition function, that is, a map $\delta \colon Q \times \Sigma \to Q$;
\item
$q_0$ is the initial state;
\item
$F \subset Q$ is the set of final states.
\end{itemize}
The sets $Q$ and $\Sigma$ are assumed to be finite, and $F$ non-empty.
