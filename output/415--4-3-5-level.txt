Godel's incompleteness theorems
Denote by  the language of  (that is, the set of all formulas in the signature of ).
There is an injective map

L 
called Godel numbering such that its image  is a recursive set.
(Such a map can be constructed by associating to every symbol a number (similarly ASCII encoding) and then encoding a sequence of numbers by a single number
for example through , where  is the -th prime number.)
That the image of this map is recursive means that there is an algorithm which determines for any number  whether it encodes a well-formed formula.
It is clear how to reconstruct a sequence of symbols from its Godel number, and it is clear how to check whether a sequence of symbols is a formula.

The Godel numbering can be extended to sequences of formulas:

L^* .

A proof of a formula can be represented as a sequence of formulas
(this is so in the Hilbert proof system, for the Gentzen system one has to agree how to transform a tree into a list; this is doable).
Thus every proof has a Godel number as well, with different numbers corresponding to different proofs (and some numbers not corresponding to any proof).

Godel numbering allows to speak about recursive sets of formulas.

Let  denote the set of all theorems of theory .
