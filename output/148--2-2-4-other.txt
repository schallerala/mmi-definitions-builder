proof
Both statements are proved by contraposition.
That is, we prove the following: if  contains no cycle, then ; if  is connected, then .

Let  be acyclic.
Then by Corollary cor:ForestEdges it has  edges, where  is the number of components of .

Let  be connected.
By Theorem thm:SpanTree,  has a spanning tree which, by Theorem thm:TreeEdges, has  edges.
Thus  has at least  edges.
