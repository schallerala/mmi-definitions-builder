We don't give a proof of the above theorem, but there is a simple algorithm that allows to compute the coefficients , respectively .
Bring the equation to a common denominator, it becomes an equation between the numerators.
The numerators are polynomials; they are equal if and only if their corresponding coefficients are equal.
This yields a system of linear equations on the unknowns  (respectively ).

Because of

11-_i x = 1 + _i x + _i^2 x^2 + 
the first part of the above theorem implies that every linear recursive sequence has the form ,
if the characteristic polynomial has only simple roots .
In the case of multiple roots we need to represent the quotient  as a formal power series.
