The matrix $L$ has zero determinant (because the vector $(1, 1, \ldots, 1)$ belongs to its kernel).
Moreover, its rank equals $n-k$, where $n = |V|$ and $k$ is the number of connected components of $G$.
In particular, if $G$ is connected, then $L$ contains an $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ minor with non-zero determinant.
In fact, $\det L = 0$ implies that all cofactors $(-1)^{i+j} \det L_{ij}$ are equal (you can try to prove this).
This common value is the number of the spanning trees.
