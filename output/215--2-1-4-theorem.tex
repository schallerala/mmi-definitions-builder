\begin{thm}
Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V = \{v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n\}$ and let $A$ be its adjacency matrix.
Let $a^{(k)}_{ij}$ denote the element of the matrix $A^k$ at the position $(i,j)$.
Then $a^{(k)}_{ij}$ is the number of walks of length exactly $k$ from the vertex $v_i$ to the vertex $v_j$ in the graph $G$.
