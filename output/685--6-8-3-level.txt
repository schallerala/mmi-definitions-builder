Modifications of Turing machines
There are several variations of Turing machines, e. g.:
itemize
multi-tape: several tapes, each with its own head for reading and writing;
multidimensional: a square grid instead of a tape, the head can move not only left and right, but also up and down;
non-deterministic.
itemize
Although they seem more powerful, each of them can be simulated by an ordinary Turing machine.



Problems and languages
Consider a problem like "Is a given finite graph connected?"
An instance of a problem is any finite graph.
Since graphs can be encoded as words in an alphabet, this problem determines a language:
the set of all words encoding connected graphs.
This holds for any question which depends on some countable parameter and has a yes/no answer:
encode the parameter values by words, and consider the set of all words for which the answer to the question is "yes".
