Regular expressions
A regular expression is a formula which describes a language.
We will see that languages represented by regular expressions are regular (i.e. are accepted by a finite automaton)
and that every regular language can be represented by a regular expression.

Definition and examples
A regular expression is defined recursively.
The basic building blocks are the following.
enumerate
 is a regular expression and denotes the language .
 is a regular expression and denotes the language .
 is a regular expression for every  and denotes the language .
enumerate
Don't confuse the empty language  and the language  consisting of an empty word.



Sometimes one uses the boldface  to denote the language .
We will use the same symbol .

From these building blocks one constructs more complex regular expressions by using the following operations.
If  and  are regular expressions denoting the languages  and  respectively, then
enumerate
 is a regular expression and denotes the language ;
 is a regular expression and denotes the language ;
 is a regular expression and denotes the language , where 
(the Kleene closure of language ).
