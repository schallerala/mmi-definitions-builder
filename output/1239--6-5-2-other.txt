Let  be a language without .
By Lemma lem:NoENoUnit there is a grammar  without  and unit productions such that .
If a production of  has a single symbol on the right, then this symbol is a terminal, so the production is of the form .

Any other production of  has the form

A X_1 X_2 X_n, n 2,

where every  is either a variable or a terminal.
If  is a terminal, then introduce a new variable  and a new production .
In the "long" () right hand sides of all productions replace  by .
Clearly, the new grammar  generates the same language as the old one.

In the grammar , all productions are of the form  or , .
Create a new grammar  by introducing for each production of a "long" () word a new set of variables 
and replacing this production by a set of productions

A B_1D_1, D_1 B_2D_2, , D_n-3 B_n-2D_n-2, D_n-2 B_n-1B_n.

Again, it is not hard to convince yourself that the new grammar generates the same language.
