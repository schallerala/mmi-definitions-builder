\begin{dfn}
A sentence $A$ is said to be a \emph{syntactic consequence} of a theory $T$ (denoted $T \vdash A$) if
there is a deduction tree with $\Gamma \vdash A$ at the root, where $\Gamma \subset T$ is any finite subset, and logical axioms at the leaves.
One says that $A$ is a \emph{theorem} of theory $T$.
The set of all theorems of $T$ is denoted by $\Th(T)$.
