An example showing that $y$ should not occur freely in $A$:
\[
\exists x A = \exists x (P(x) \wedge \neg P(y)).
\]
This formula is satisfiable in any structure where the interpretation of predicate $P$ is not constant.
But after the quantifier removal and substitution of $y$ for $x$ it becomes
\[
A[y/x] = P(y) \wedge \neg P(y),
\]
which is not satisfiable.
