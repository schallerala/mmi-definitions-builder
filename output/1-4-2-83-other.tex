\begin{proof}
Multiply the brackets respecting the order of the factors.
We obtain the sum of all words of length $n$ from the letters $a_1, \ldots, a_m$.
When collecting the like terms, we disregard the order of the letters, looking only at the number of occurences of every letter.
The words with $k_i$ letters $a_i$ (for all $i$ from $1$ to $m$) become the terms $a_1^{k_1} \cdots a_m^{k_m}$.
The coefficient at this term is the number of the words made of $k_1$ letters $a_1$,... $k_m$ letters $a_m$,
that is $\binom{n}{k_1, \ldots, k_m}$.
\end{proof}
