proof
Let .
Use induction on .
For , there is only one tree with one vertex.
It has no edges, which proves the induction base.

Now let us prove the induction step: if every tree with  vertices has  edges, then every tree with  vertices has  edges.
Take any tree  with  vertices.
By Lemma lem:LeafTree it has a leaf .
By Lemma lem:LeafDel the graph  is also a tree.
The tree  has  vertices, therefore by the induction assumption it has  edges.
But then  has  edges, and the induction step is proved.
