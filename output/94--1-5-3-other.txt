proof
Let  be the set of numbers among  divisible by .
Then  and we have

(n) = n - A_1 A_m.

To compute , use the inclusion-exclusion formula.
We have

A_i = p_i, 2p_i, , np_i p_i,

thus .
Similarly, we have

A_i_1 A_i_k = np_i_1 p_i_k.

By the inclusion-exclusion formula,

A_1 A_m = _i=1^m np_i - _i<j np_ip_j + + (-1)^m-1 np_1p_m.

Thus we have

(n) = n - A_1 A_m

= n ( 1 - _i<j 1p_i + + (-1)^m 1p_1 p_m )

= n (1-1p_1) (1-1p_m).
