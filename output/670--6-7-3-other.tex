\begin{proof}
Consider the languages
\begin{gather*}
L = \{a^ib^ic^i \mid i \ge 1\},\\
L_1 = \{a^ib^ic^j \mid i, j \ge 1\},\\
L_2 = \{a^ib^jc^j \mid i, j \ge 1\}.
\end{gather*}
We have $L = L_1 \cap L_2$.
As we know, $L$ is not context-free.
On the other hand $L_1$ is generated by the grammar
\[
S \to AB, \quad A \to aAb \mid ab, \quad B \to cB \mid c.
\]
The language $L_2$ is generated by a similar grammar.
Thus $L_1$ and $L_2$ are context-free languages whose intersection is not context-free.
\end{proof}
