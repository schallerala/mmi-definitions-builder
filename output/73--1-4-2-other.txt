Multiply the brackets respecting the order of the factors.
We obtain the sum of all words of length  from the letters .
When collecting the like terms, we disregard the order of the letters, looking only at the number of occurences of every letter.
The words with  letters  (for all  from  to ) become the terms .
The coefficient at this term is the number of the words made of  letters ,...  letters ,
that is .
