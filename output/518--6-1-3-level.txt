Nondeterministic finite automata
In a nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA) one allows the transition from a given state on a given input to be not uniquely defined or undefined.
In other words, while on the transition diagram of a DFA for every state  and every input symbol  there is a unique outgoing arrow from  labeled with ,
on the transition diagram of an NFA there might be several arrows like that or none at all.
Figure fig:NFA shows an example of an NFA.

A formal definition is as follows.
