DNF is not unique: different formulas in DNF can be equivalent.
The procedure described in Theorem \ref{thm:BooleNF} produces a disjunction of clauses of length $n$ (where $n$ is the number of variables in the input formula).
For example, the formula $p \vee q$ (although it is already in DNF) will be represented by $(p \wedge q) \vee (p \wedge \neg q) \vee (\neg p \wedge q)$.
The same applies to CNF.
