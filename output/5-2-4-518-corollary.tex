\begin{cor}
\label{cor:GenBinom}
For every $\alpha \in \R$ put by definition
\[
(1 + x)^\alpha = \sum_{k=0}^\infty \binom{\alpha}{k} x^k
\]
(which for $\alpha \in \N$ agrees with the binomial formula, so that this definition does not override the usual definition of $(1+x)^n$).
Then for every $\alpha, \beta \in \R$ the following identity between formal power series holds:
\[
(1+x)^\alpha (1+x)^\beta = (1+x)^{\alpha + \beta}.
\]
In particular, for every $p \in \Z$ and $q \in \N$ one has
\[
\left( (1+x)^{\frac{p}{q}} \right)^q = (1+x)^p.
\]
