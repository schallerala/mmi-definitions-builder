Imagine a bag with  balls numbered by .
We are taking out a ball, writing down its number, and then putting the ball back into the bag.
This is done  times.
From the product rule we know that  different sequences of numbers are possible.
(One can see such a sequence as a map : here  is the number at the -th place.)
But what if we don't care for the order of the results, but only count how often each ball was taken?
For example, the sequences  and  are considered as the same.
How many different combinations of balls are possible?

One cannot proceed by the quotient rule, because the number of different orderings of a sequence with repetitions depends on how often the repetitions occur.
