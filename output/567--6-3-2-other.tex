\begin{proof}
Since $L$ is a regular language, there is a DFA accepting it.
Let $n$ be the number of states of such a DFA.
Then any word $z \in L$ determines a path of length $|z|$ from $q_0$ to one of the final states.
By Lemma \ref{lem:LongWord}, if $|z| \ge n$, then within the first $n$ edges of this path there is a cycle.
Let $u$ be the prefix of $z$ before the beginning of this cycle, let $v$ be the subword corresponding to the cycle, and let $w$ be the remaining suffix.
Then $z = uvw$, and the path determined by the word $uv^kw$ differs from the path determined by $uvw$ in the number of times it runs along the cycle of $v$,
but has the same endpoint, a final state of the DFA.
Thus $uv^kw \in L$ for all $k \ge 0$.
\end{proof}
