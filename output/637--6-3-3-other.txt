proof
Let  be a regular language, and let  be a regular expression representing .
Make a substitution in , replacing every symbol by its image under the homomorphism.
The result is a regular expression in the alphabet ; denote it by .
Then the language defined by  is , thus  is regular.

The claim  is proved by induction on the complexity of the expression .
Here is the induction step to :
multline*
L(h(r_1+r_2)) = L(h(r_1)+h(r_2)) = L(h(r_1)) L(h(r_2))

= h(L(r_1)) h(L(r_2)) = h(L(r_1) L(r_2)) = h(L(r_1+r_2)).
multline*
proof

For example, if  and , then .

The next example shows that a homomorphic image of a non-regular language can be regular.
