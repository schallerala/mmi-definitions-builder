For a recursive theory there is an algorithm which, for any given formula, tells us in finite time whether this formula is an axiom of our theory or not.
This is a very reasonable condition for a theory: one should be able to distinguish axioms from non-axioms.
For a decidable theory there is an algorithm which, for any given formula, tells us whether this formula can be derived from the axioms or not.
