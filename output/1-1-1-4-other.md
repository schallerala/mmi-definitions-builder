*If $X \cap Y = \varnothing$, then $|X \cup Y| = |X| + |Y|$.*

More generally,

*If the sets $X_1, \ldots, X_n$ are pairwise disjoint (that is
$X_i \cap X_j = \varnothing$ for all $i \ne j$), then
$|X_1 \cup X_2 \cup \cdots \cup X_n| = |X_1| + |X_2| + \cdots + |X_n|$.*

Formally, this follows by induction on $n$ from the sum rule for two
sets.

Later we will learn how to proceed if the sets are not disjoint.
