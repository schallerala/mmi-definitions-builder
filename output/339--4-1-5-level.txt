Propositional logic inside predicate logic
Consider the signature without functions and with nullary predicates only:
equation
eqn:NullSign
: P_1(), P_2(), equation
Formulas in this signature contain no terms, because a term must occur as an argument of a predicate, but nullary predicates have no arguments.
We can introduce variables in the formulas only with quantifiers by writing something like ,
but in any structure this formula evaluates in the same way as .
Thus the formulas in signature eqn:NullSign look like propositional formulas with variable symbols .

How does  actually evaluate?
By definition, a first-order structure  assigns to each nullary predicate  a truth value .
Then the truth value of  is  (and the universe  has no significance).
Similarly for every other formula: an evaluation with respect to interpretation  is the same as evaluation of a propositional formula
with  viewed as valuation .

Thus signature eqn:NullSign realizes the propositional logic as a special case of the predicate logic.
One can state this as follows.
