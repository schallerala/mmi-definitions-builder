proof[First proof]
This is immediate from eqn:NChooseK: if we replace  by , then the factors in the denominator simply interchange.

proof[Second proof]
The theorem can be proved even without knowing a formula for , by a bijective argument.
Associate to every subset of an -element set its complement: .
This is a bijection, and it sends -element subsets to -element subsets.
Thus there are as many -element subsets as there are -element subsets.
