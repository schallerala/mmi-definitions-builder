\begin{itemize}
\item
$\Sigma = \Delta = \{0\}$, $L = \Sigma^*$, $h(0) = 00$. Then $h(L)$ consists of all even length sequences of zeros.
\item
$\Sigma = \Delta = \{0, 1\}$, $L = \Sigma^*$, $h(0) = 0, h(1) = 10$. For every word $w$ its image $h(w)$ is obtained by inserting a $0$ after every $1$.
The language $h(L)$ consists of all words without two consecutive $1$'s and not ending with $1$.
