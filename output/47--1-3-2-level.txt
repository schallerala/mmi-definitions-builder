Monotone paths
Take the square lattice in the plane.
The nodes of the lattice can be identified with pairs of integers  (Cartesian coordinates).
Take two non-negative integers  and mark the points  and .
A lattice path from  to  is a sequence of segments of the square lattice
that leads from  to .
A lattice path is called monotone if it runs only upwards and to the right.
See an example on Figure fig:MonPath.
