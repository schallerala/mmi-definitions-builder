\begin{proof}
If we have an algorithm for computing $\mathbf{1}_X$, then modify it by going into an endless loop if the output is $0$.
This computes the function $\overline{\mathbf{1}}_X$. The function $\overline{\mathbf{1}}_{\N^p \setminus X}$ is computed similarly.

If one has an algorithm which stops only for inputs $x \in X$ and an algorithm which stops only for inputs $x \notin X$, then run them parallelly
and interpret the output of the first algorithm as $1$, and the output of the second algorithm as $0$.
This allows us to compute the function $\mathbf{1}_X$.
\end{proof}
