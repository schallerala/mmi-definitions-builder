\begin{dfn}
A \emph{Turing machine} is
\[
M = (Q, \Sigma, \Gamma, \delta, q_0, B, F),
\]
where
\begin{itemize}
\item
$Q$ is the set of states, $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state, and $F \subset Q$ is the set of final states;
\item
$\Gamma$ is the set of \emph{tape symbols}, $\Sigma \subset \Gamma$ is the set of \emph{input symbols},
and $B \in \Gamma \setminus \Sigma$ is the \emph{blank} symbol;
\item
$\delta \colon Q \times \Gamma \to Q \times \Gamma \times \{L, R\}$
is a partial map (that is, it can be undefined for some arguments), called the \emph{move function}.
\end{itemize}
