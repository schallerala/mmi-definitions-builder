\begin{proof}
Proof by contraposition.
Let $T$ be an inconsistent theory: there is a sentence $A$ such that $T \vdash A$ and $T \vdash \neg A$.
Assume that $T$ is satisfiable: $M \vDash T$.
Then the soundness of the proof system implies that $M \vDash A$ and $M \vDash \neg A$, which is a contradiction.
Thus every inconsistent theory is unsatisfiable.
\end{proof}

The inverse implication is also correct; it can be derived from the completeness theorem and vice versa by some manipulations with deduction trees.
Therefore it is also called the completeness theorem.
