Computing the first few terms of the sequences $\frac{3k^2 \pm k}2$, one rewrites MacMahon's recurrence as
\[
p_n = p_{n-1} + p_{n-2} - p_{n-5} - p_{n-7} + p_{n-12} + p_{n-15} - \cdots
\]
The sum on the right hand side looks infinite but is in fact finite: $p(n-i)$ becomes zero as soon as $i$ exceeds $n$.
Thus the sum contains about $2\sqrt{\frac{2}{3} n}$ summands and allows a very fast computation of $p_n$.

MacMahon, more than a hundred years ago, has computed $p(n)$ for $n$ up to $200$.
In particular, he found that
\[
p(200) = 3 972 999 029 388.
\]

We will prove MacMahon's recurrence in the next section.
