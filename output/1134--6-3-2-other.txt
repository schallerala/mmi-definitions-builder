proof
1) The path corresponding to the shortest accepted word does not visit any state more than once.
Otherwise it contains a cycle, and by removing this cycle we obtain a shorter accepted word.
Therefore the length of the shortest accepted word is strictly less than .

2) The "if" direction. If  is an accepted word of length , then its path contains a cycle.
By pumping this cycle, we obtain infinitely many accepted words.

The "only if" direction. If the language is infinite, then it contains a word  with .
If , then we are done.
If , then write  as  according to the pumping lemma.
Then  is also accepted, and we have .
Thus we can apply the same case distiction to the word  and proceed until we get a word of length  and .
