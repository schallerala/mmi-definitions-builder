We will find a spanning tree by deleting edges from the graph one by one while taking care that the graph remains connected.
For any graph  and any its edge  denote by  the graph .
(Note that we are not removing any vertices, even if after deletion of  an isolated vertex appears.)
This is the operation of edge deletion.
proof
Let  be a connected graph.
If  contains a cycle , then let  be any edge of .
I claim that the graph  is connected.
Indeed, let  be any two vertices of .
Since  is connected, there is a path in  between  and .
If this path never uses the edge , then this is also a path in .
If it does use , then instead going on , take a detour via the path .
This produces a walk in  from  to .
A walk can be transformed into a path by removing cycles.

Thus  is connected.
If it is acyclic, then it is a spanning tree.
Otherwise repeat the operation: take another cycle and remove an edge from it etc.
until we arrive at an acyclic connected subgraph with the same vertex set as .
proof

The following theorem is a strengthening of Theorem thm:TreeEdges.
