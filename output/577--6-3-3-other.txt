proof
Let us prove the uniqueness.
If we know  for all , then we have no other choice but put

h(a_1 a_n) = h(a_1) h(a_n).

Also by definition of a homomorphism one has

h(x) = h(x) = h() h(x),

which implies .
Thus there is no more than one homomorphism with given values on the letters of the alphabet.

On the other hand, putting  and  defines a homomorphism,
so the extension exists and is unique.
