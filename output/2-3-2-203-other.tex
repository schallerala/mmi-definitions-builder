\begin{proof}
Induction on the number of edges.

Let $|E| = 0$. The only connected graph without edges is the graph with one vertex.
It has one face, and we have $1 - 0 + 1 = 2$. The induction base is proved.

Now take a graph with $n$ edges, $n \ge 1$.
Consider two cases.

\noindent 1) The graph is acyclic.
Then it is a tree. A tree does not separate the plane, so we have $|F| = 1$ in this case.
By Theorem \ref{thm:TreeEdges}, $|E| = |V|-1$.
Thus we have
\[
|V| - |E| + |F| = |V| - (|V|-1) + 1 = 2.
\]

\noindent 2) The graph contains a cycle.
Let $C \subset G$ be any cycle and let $e$ be any edge of $C$.
The graph $G - e$ is still connected and has one edge less.
Let us show that it also has one face less.
Indeed, the points on different sides of $e$ belong to different faces of $G$:
any arc connecting them must intersect the cycle $C$.
These two faces are merged to one face in $G - e$; all other faces are unchanged.
Thus $G$ has the same number of vertices, one edge less, and one face less than $G - e$.
By the induction assumption, Euler's formula holds for $G - e$.
Thus it also holds for $G$.
