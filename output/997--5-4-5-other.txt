proof
Let us show that the sequence  of numbers of Dyck paths satisfies the same recurrence relation that the sequence of Catalan numbers.
Take a path from  to  and let  be the first point after  where it touches the diagonal.
The number  can take any value between  and .
The point  separates the path into two parts.
The first part never touches the diagonal except at the endpoints.
If we remove from it the initial and the terminal segments, then we get a Dyck path from  to .
It can be identified by translation with a Dyck path from  to .
The part of the path after the point  can be identified with a Dyck path from  to .

Conversely, from any -Dyck path and any -Dyck path one can build a -Dyck path
by "lifting up" the -path and concatenating it with the -path.
Thus the number of -Dyck paths whose first contact with the diagonal is at  is ,
and the total number of -Dyck paths is

d_n+1 = _k=0^n d_k d_n-k.

Thus we have for the sequence  the same recursive relation, and also the same starting value .
It follows that  for all .
