Partition of integers
In this section we will count the number of decompositions of a positive integer into summands.
There are different versions of this problem.
Before coming to the most difficult and interesting one in Section subsec:Partitions we look at simpler versions.



Money changing problem
Imagine a country where only , , and  dollar banknotes are in circulation.
In how many different ways can one pay  dollars without change?

The problem can be reformulated as finding the number of integer solutions of the equation

9k + 17l + 31m = 1000, k, l, m 0

More generally, denote by  the number of different ways to pay  dollars without change.
What can one say about ?
