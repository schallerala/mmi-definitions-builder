Peano arithmetic
The signature consists of a nullary function , a unary function  (successor), two binary functions  and .
The equality predicate .
Axioms of :
enumerate








enumerate
The last item is the induction schema, that is it encodes infinitely many sentences.
Here  denotes , and  denotes .
The number  can be any non-negative integer, and  can be any formula with  free variables .


The theory consisting of the first seven axioms is called Robinson arithmetic, we will denote it by .
It does not imply that the addition is commutative.

Since we assume that  is an objective reality and the operations with positive integers satisfy the above properties,
theory  is satisfiable and hence consistent.
