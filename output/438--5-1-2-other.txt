proof
Part 1. Let us show that each of the two geometric progressions  and  satisfies
the recurrence relation eqn:LinRec2.
Indeed, one has

_i^n - r _i^n-1 - s _i^n-2 = _i^n-2(_i^2 - r _i - s) = 0,

which implies .
It follows that for any constant coefficients  and  the sequence 
also satisfies the relation eqn:LinRec2.

Let us show that the coefficients  and  can be chosen so that
gather*
c_1  + c_2 = a_0

c_1 _1 + c_2 _2 = a_1.
gather*
This is a system of two linear equations for two unknowns  and ,
which has a (unique) solution because the matrix of the system has a non-zero determinant:

vmatrix
1 & 1

_1 & _2
vmatrix
= _2 - _1 0.

Once the sequences  and  coincide in the first two terms,
they coincide everywhere. This proves the first part of the Theorem.


Part 2. The proof is similar, but as the basis sequences we take  and .
The first of them satisfies the linear recurrence by the same reason as in Part 1.
To check the recurrence for the second sequence, observe that  being the double root of the characteristic polynomial
means that

x^2 - rx - s = (x-)^2 r = 2, s = -^2.

Thus we have
multline*
n^n - r(n-1)^n-1 - s(n-2)^n-2 = ^n-2(n^2 - 2(n-1)+ ^2(n-2))

= ^n(n - 2(n-1) + (n-2)) = 0.
multline*
As next one has to find the coefficients  and  which make the linear combination 
to coincide with the sequence  in the first two terms:
gather*
c_1 = a_0

c_1 + c_2 = a_1.
gather*
Clearly, this linear system has a solution.
proof

Let us apply the algorithm from the above proof to find an explicit formula for Fibonacci numbers.

The characteristic polynomial is . Its roots are
equation
eqn:FibRoots
_1 = 1 + 52, _2 = 1 - 52.
equation
If we start the Fibonacci sequence from the zeroth term so that the recurrence relation holds between , ,  as well, 
then we must put .
Thus the coefficients  and  are found from the system
gather*
c_1 + c_2 = 0

c_1_1 + c_2_2 = 1.
gather*
From the first equation one has . Substituting this into the second equation one obtains

c_1 = 1_1 - _2 = 15.

The result is the formula of Binet:

a_n = 15 _1^n - 15 _2^n.
