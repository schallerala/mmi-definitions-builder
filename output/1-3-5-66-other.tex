\begin{proof}
Lay $n$ stones in a row.
To form a composition of the number $n$ we must separate these stones by $k-1$ sticks.
The numbers of stones between consecutive sticks sum up to $n$, thus form a composition of $n$.
For example,
\[
\bullet\, | \bullet\, \bullet\, \bullet |\, \bullet \quad \longleftrightarrow \quad 5 = 1+3+1
\]
In how many ways can we put $k-1$ sticks between $n$ stones?
There are $n-1$ gaps, and we must choose $k-1$ of them.
There are $\binom{n-1}{k-1}$ ways to do this. The theorem is proved.
\end{proof}
