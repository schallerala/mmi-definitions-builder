In particular, for the complete graph we have the determinant of the following  matrix:

pmatrix
n-1 & -1 & & -1

-1 & n-1 & & -1

& & & 

-1 & -1 & & n-1
pmatrix.

Cayley's theorem indicates that it is equal to .
Of course, it is easier (but still not straightforward) to prove this equality without invoking two difficult theorems above.
