The language  consisting of all binary words with an equal number of zeros and ones is not regular.
Indeed, assume the contrary, and let  be the integer in the pumping lemma.
Then .
By the pumping lemma, one can write , where , and  for all .
It follows that the words  and  consist of zeros only.
Since , the word  has less zeros than ones, thus it does not belong to .
This contradiction shows that our assumption was false.
