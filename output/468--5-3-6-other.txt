proof
Conjugation defines a self-bijection of the set of all partitions of .
Diagrams with  rows are conjugate to diagrams with  columns,
thus the number of diagrams of the first kind is equal to the number of diagrams of the second kind.
On the other hand, diagrams with  rows correspond to partitions into  parts,
and diagrams with  columns correspond to partitions whose largest part is equal to .
Thus we have as many partitions of the first kind as partitions of the second kind.

For partitions into at most  parts and partitions with all parts  the argument is similar.
proof


Let us present another elegant statement about partitions.
First, call a partition  self-conjugate if it is conjugate to itself:
the Ferrers diagram of  is symmetric with respect to the northwest-southeast diagonal.
Figure fig:FerrersSelfConj shows all self-conjugate partitions of .
