At the first sight it is not clear at all that this formula produces a rational and even integer number.

A direct consequence of the Binet formula is that the Fibonacci sequence grows as a geometric progression with ratio
equal to the golden ratio
\[
\tau = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}2 = 1,618\ldots.
\]
Indeed, the second summand is
\[
\left(\frac{1-\sqrt{5}}2\right)^n = (-0,618\ldots)^n \to 0 \text{ as } n \to \infty,
\]
which implies that
\[
a_n \sim \frac{\tau^n}{\sqrt{5}},
\]
and even more exactly
\[
a_n = \left\lfloor \frac{\tau^n}{\sqrt{5}} \right\rceil,
\]
where $\lfloor x \rceil$ denotes the closest integer to the number $x$.
