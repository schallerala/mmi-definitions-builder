proof
Induction on the number of vertices.

For trees with one vertex the statement is trivial.

Assume that the statement is proved for all deduction trees with  vertices.
Let  be a deduction tree with  vertices.
By definition, if we delete the root of , then we obtain one or two deduction trees "growing" from the children of the root,
see Figure fig:InductionDedTree.
Besides, the root of  is the conclusion and its children are the premises of an inference rule.
Hence by Lemma lem:RuleTrees a valuation falsifies the root if and only if it falsifies one of its children.
The subtrees growing from the children have  vertices,
therefore by induction assumption a valuation falsifies a child if and only if it falsifies one of the leaves of the corresponding subtree.
Such a vertex is also childless in the big tree.
This proves the induction step.

proof[Proof of Theorem thm:GentzenSound]
We want to show that for every proof tree the sequent at its root is valid.
By Lemma lem:FalsifyRoot, if some valuation falsifies the root, then it falsifies one of the leaves.
But all leaves of a proof tree are axioms, and by Lemma lem:AxiomValid they cannot be falsified.
