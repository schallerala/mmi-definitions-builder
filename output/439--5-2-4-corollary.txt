For every  put by definition

(1 + x)^= _k=0^k x^k

(which for  agrees with the binomial formula, so that this definition does not override the usual definition of ).
Then for every  the following identity between formal power series holds:

(1+x)^(1+x)^= (1+x)^+ .

In particular, for every  and  one has

( (1+x)^pq )^q = (1+x)^p.
