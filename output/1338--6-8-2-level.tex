\subsection{Modifications of Turing machines}
There are several variations of Turing machines, e.~g.:
\begin{itemize}
\item
multi-tape: several tapes, each with its own head for reading and writing;
\item
multidimensional: a square grid instead of a tape, the head can move not only left and right, but also up and down;
\item
non-deterministic.
\end{itemize}
Although they seem more powerful, each of them can be simulated by an ordinary Turing machine.
