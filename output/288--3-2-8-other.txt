proof
By Lemma lem:FalsifyRoot, a valuation  satisfies  if and only if it satisfies all leaves of the deduction tree.
The leaf  is satisfied if and only if
the disjunctive clause above is satisfied (see Definition dfn:FalsifySequent).
Finally,  satisfies all leaves if and only if it satisfies the conjunction of all these clauses.
proof

One constructs a DNF for  in a similar way starting from the sequent .
