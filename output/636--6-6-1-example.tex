\begin{exl}
Consider the language of binary palindromes with a symbol $c$ (``center'') in the middle:
\[
L = \{w c \bar{w} \mid w \in \{0,1\}^*\}.
\]
We describe a deterministic PDA accepting $L$ by the empty stack. Put
\[
M = (\{q_1, q_2\}, \{0, 1, c\}, \{A, B, Z_0\}, \delta, q_1, Z_0, \emptyset\}.
\]
While the automaton is in the state $q_1$, it stores the input in the stack encoding $0$ with $A$ and $1$ with $B$:
\[
\delta(q_1, 0, Z) = (q_1, AZ) \quad \delta(q_1, 1, Z) = (q_1, BZ) \text{ for all }Z \in \Gamma.
\]
If the input symbol is $c$, then the automaton switches to the state $q_2$:
\[
\delta(q_1, c, Z) = (q_2, Z) \text{ for all }Z \in \Gamma.
\]
While in the state $q_2$, the automaton compares the input symbol with the top symbol in the stack.
If the symbols agree, then the top symbol is removed; if they disagree, the automaton ``breaks down''.
\[
\delta(q_2, 0, A) = (q_2, \epsilon) \quad \delta(q_2, 1, B) = (q_2, \epsilon)
\]
Finally, when the automaton sees the start symbol at the bottom of the stack, this symbol is removed, and the word is accepted:
\[
\delta(q_2, \epsilon, Z_0) = (q_2, \epsilon).
\]
