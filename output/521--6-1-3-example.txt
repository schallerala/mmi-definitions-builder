[a)]
The automaton in Figure fig:NFA accepts all words that contain two consecutive zeros.
Indeed, the state  can be reached only if the input contains two consecutive zeros,
and once  is reached, one stays there forever.

Indeed, it "breaks down" only if the input contains two consecutive zeros, and if it does not break down, then it accepts the input.
