Note that  is related to the characteristic polynomial  through

P(x) = x^k P(1x).

It follows that the roots of the polynomial  are reciprocals of the roots of .
More exactly, if , then

P(x) = (1 - _1 x)^k_1 (1- _m)^k_m.


The following theorem generalizes our representation of the fraction  as a sum of two simpler fractions.
