Note that the alphabet $V$ of variables and the alphabet $T$ of terminals must be disjoint.
To avoid confusion, we will use different symbols in the following way.
\begin{itemize}
\item
The capital letters $A, B, C, \ldots$ are variables.
\item
The letters $a, b, c$ and digits are terminals.
\item
The letters $X, Y, Z$ denote symbols that may be variables or terminals.
\item
The letters $u, v, w, x, y, z$ are used to denote strings of terminals, that is elements of $T^*$.
\item
The letters $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ are used to denote strings of variables and terminals, that is elements of $(V \cup T)^*$.
\end{itemize}
