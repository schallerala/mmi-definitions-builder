A graph  is a subdivision of a graph  if  is obtained from  by repeated edge subdivisions.
To subdivide an edge  of a graph  means to introduce a new vertex , delete , and introduce two new edges  and .
Figure fig:KSubdivisions shows a subdivision of  and a subdivision of .

One direction of the Kuratowski theorem is easy to prove: If a graph contains a subdivision of  or , then it cannot be planar.
Indeed, an embedding of the graph would contain an embedding of a subdivision of  or ,
and hence an embedding of  or .
It is the opposite direction which is the most interesting and non-obvious:
the only obstacles to existence of a planar embedding of  are graphs  or  contained in  (in the form of subdivisions).


There is a similar planarity criterion that uses the notion of a minor.
