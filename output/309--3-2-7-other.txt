proof
For a given sequent, consider its closed deduction tree.
It has leaves of two kinds:
itemize
Leaves labeled with axioms  such that  for some , .
Leaves with labels  such that  for all , .
These are called counterexample leaves.
itemize
A counterexample leaf is falsifiable: it suffices to set  for all  and  for all .
Thus if the closed deduction tree has a counterexample leaf, then the sequent at the root is also falsifiable.

If our sequent is valid, then all of the leaves are of the first kind, and the tree is a proof tree.
proof

Note that we get more than just completeness: constructing a closed deduction tree provides a concrete counterexample to a falsifiable sequent.
