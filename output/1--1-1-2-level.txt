Basic combinatorics

How to count
All sets in this chapter are finite.

For a finite set , by  we denote the number of elements in , also called the cardinality of .

Sum rule
center
If , then .
center

More generally,
center
.9If the sets  are pairwise disjoint
(that is  for all ),
then .
center
Formally, this follows by induction on  from the sum rule for two sets.

Later we will learn how to proceed if the sets are not disjoint.

Product rule
First, let us state a special product rule:

X Y = X Y.

Here , the Cartesian product of  and , denotes the set of ordered pairs  with , .

The elements of  can be written in a table whose rows correspond to the elements of ,
and the columns correspond to the elements of .
This justifies the product rule.

Again, there is an extension to several sets:

X_1 X_n = X_1 X_n.
