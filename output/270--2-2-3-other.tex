\begin{proof}
Let $|V| = n$.
Use induction on $n$.
For $n=1$, there is only one tree with one vertex.
It has no edges, which proves the induction base.

Now let us prove the induction step: if every tree with $n$ vertices has $n-1$ edges, then every tree with $n+1$ vertices has $n$ edges.
Take any tree $T$ with $n+1$ vertices.
By Lemma \ref{lem:LeafTree} it has a leaf $v$.
By Lemma \ref{lem:LeafDel} the graph $T - v$ is also a tree.
The tree $T - v$ has $n$ vertices, therefore by the induction assumption it has $n-1$ edges.
But then $T$ has $n$ edges, and the induction step is proved.
\end{proof}
