\begin{dfn}
\label{dfn:LogEqProp}
Two propositions $A$ and $B$ are called \emph{logically equivalent}, which is denoted by $A \simeq B$ if they are satisfied by the same valuations:
\[
\hat{v}(A) = \hat{v}(B) \text{ for all }v.
\]
In other words, $A \simeq B$ if and only if $A$ and $B$ have the same truth table.
\end{dfn}
