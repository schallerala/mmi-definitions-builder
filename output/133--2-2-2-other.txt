proof
Take a path  of maximum length.
(If there are several paths of maximum length, take one of them.)
I claim that its endpoints  and  are leaves.
Indeed, assume .
Then there is an edge of  incident with  and not belonging to .
If the other end of this edge is also a vertex of , then  contains a cycle, which contradicts to it being a tree.
If the other end is not in , then adding it to  we obtain a longer path.
This contradicts the choice of .
Thus the assumption  was false,  is a leaf, and  is a leaf as well.
