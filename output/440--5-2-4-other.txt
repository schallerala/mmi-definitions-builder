It follows that one can extract -th root from any formal power series with non-zero constant term.

proof[Proof of Theorem thm:Vandermonde]
Step 1. If  and  are positive integers, then

m + nk = _i=0^k mi nk-i

can be proved by a combinatorial argument:  is the number of different choices of  elements from the set .
To choose  elements, one has to choose  elements among  and  elements among  for some  between  and .
The number of such choices is .
Summing over  we obtain the desired formula.

Step 2. Let us prove

+ nk = _i=0^k i nk-i

for all  and all positive integers .
For fixed  and  the left hand side of the above formula is a polynomial in  of degree ;
the right hand side is also a polynomial in  of degree .
Both polynomials take equal values at  for all positive integers .
It follows that the polynomials are identical
(if two polynomials of degree  coincide at  points, then their difference is a polynomial of degree  with  roots, hence identically zero).

Step 3. Finally let us prove

+ k = _i=0^k i k-i

for all .
Fix  and . Then the left and the right hand sides are polynomials in  of degree .
By Step 2, the values of these polynomials coincide whenever  is a positive integer.
Thus the polynomials are identically equal.
(In particular, evaluating the left hand side and the right hand side for any values of  leads to the same results.)
