\begin{proof}[First proof]
This is immediate from \eqref{eqn:NChooseK}: if we replace $k$ by $n-k$, then the factors in the denominator simply interchange.
\end{proof}
\begin{proof}[Second proof]
The theorem can be proved even without knowing a formula for $\binom{n}{k}$, by a bijective argument.
Associate to every subset of an $n$-element set its complement: $A \mapsto X \setminus A$.
This is a bijection, and it sends $k$-element subsets to $(n-k)$-element subsets.
Thus there are as many $k$-element subsets as there are $(n-k)$-element subsets.
\end{proof}
