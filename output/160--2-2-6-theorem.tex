\begin{thm}[Kruskal's algorithm]
Order the edges of a weighted connected graph according to their weights:
\[
(e_1, \ldots, e_m) \quad \text{such that} \quad \omega(e_1) \le \cdots \le \omega(e_m).
\]
Going through this list, mark an edge if it does not create a cycle together with the previously marked edges.
More exactly, put $G_0 = (V, \emptyset)$: the graph with isolated vertices only.
If $G_i$ is already defined, then put
\[
G_{i+1} =
\begin{cases}
G_i + e_{i+1} &\text{ if } G_i + e_{i+1} \text{ has no cycles}\\
G_i &\text{ otherwise.}
\end{cases}
\]
The output of the algorithm is the graph $G_m$.
\end{thm}
