Write two rows of $1$ starting at the same place and going one downwards to the left and the other downwards to the right.
Then fill in this frame row after row according to the rule that every number is equal to the sum
of its top-left and top-right neighbors.

\begin{tabular}{ccccccccccc}
&    &    &    &    &  1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
&    &    &    &  1 &    &  1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
&    &    &  1 &    &  2 &    &  1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
&    &  1 &    &  3 &    &  3 &    &  1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}
&  1 &    &  4 &    &  6 &    &  4 &    & 1\\\noalign{\smallskip\smallskip}

One adopts the convention that the rows of the Pascal triangle as well as the numbers in each row are numbered starting from $0$.
Thus the row number $n$ contains $n+1$ entries numbered with $0$ up to $n$.
