\section{Partition of integers}
In this section we will count the number of decompositions of a positive integer into summands.
There are different versions of this problem.
Before coming to the most difficult and interesting one in Section \ref{subsec:Partitions} we look at simpler versions.



\subsection{Money changing problem}
Imagine a country where only $9$, $17$, and $31$ dollar banknotes are in circulation.
In how many different ways can one pay $1000$ dollars without change?

The problem can be reformulated as finding the number of integer solutions of the equation
\[
9k + 17l + 31m = 1000, \quad k, l, m \ge 0
\]
More generally, denote by $a_n$ the number of different ways to pay $n$ dollars without change.
What can one say about $a_n$?
