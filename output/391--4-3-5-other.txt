proof
The set  is the set of theorems of the empty theory. Since the empty theory is recursive,  is recursively enumerable.

Denote by  the conjunction of all seven axioms of .
If  is recursive, then for any sentence  one can decide in finite time whether  belongs to  or not.
But an answer to this question is equivalent to an answer to the question whether  or not.
This contradicts the fact that  is undecidable, thus  cannot be recursive.
