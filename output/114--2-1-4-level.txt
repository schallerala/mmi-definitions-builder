Incidence and adjacency
An edge is said to be incident with a vertex if it contains this vertex.
In other words, the edge  is incident with the vertices  and .

The degree of a vertex , denoted , is the number of edges incident with .
A vertex of degree zero, that is without incident edges, is called an isolated vertex.

In the complete graph  all vertices have degree .
In the cycle , all vertices have degree .
