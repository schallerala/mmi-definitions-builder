\begin{proof}
A monotone path can be encoded by a binary word,
where $1$ stands for ``a step to the right'' and $0$ stands for ``a step upwards''.
In order to attain the point $(k,l)$, we need to make $k$ steps to the right and $l$ steps upwards.
Therefore the monotone paths from $(0,0)$ to $(k,l)$ correspond to words of length $k+l$
containing exactly $k$ digits $1$.
From Theorem \ref{thm:BinWordsK} we know that the number of such words is $\binom{k+l}{k}$.
\end{proof}
