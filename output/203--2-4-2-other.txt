proof
Let us prove that if  is a maximum matching, then there is no -augmenting path.
By contraposition we have to show that if  contains an -augmenting path, then  is not a maximum matching.
This follows from the observation we made before stating the theorem:
an augmenting path can be used to increase the number of edges in a matching.

For the opposite direction we have to show that if  is not a maximum matching, then there is an -augmenting path.
Let  be a maximum matching in .
Then .
Let  be the graph formed by those edges that belong to exactly one of  and : the edge set of  is

(M M') (M M').

(This is called symmetric difference of  and .)
Every vertex of  has degree  or  because it is incident to at most one edge from  and at most one edge from .
Therefore each connected component of  is either an even cycle with edges alternately in  and  or a path with edges alternately in  and ,
see Figure fig:MM'.

Due to , in  there are more edges from  than from .
Therefore there is a path that starts and ends with an -edge.
The endpoints of this path have no incident -edges, otherwise such an edge would also belong to , and the path would not stop here.
This path is an -augmenting path and the theorem is proved.
proof


In order to find a maximum matching in a graph, start with any matching (for example, an empty set of edges).
Then, recursively, find an augmenting path and modify the current matching.
If no augmenting path can be found, then the current matching is a maximum one.
Algorithms for finding an augmenting path are described in[Section 16.5]BM.
