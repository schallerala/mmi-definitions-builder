\begin{proof}
This is similar to the money changing problem, but with banknotes of any denomination available.

The right hand side is equal to
\[
(1+x+x^2+\cdots)(1+x^2+x^4+\cdots)(1+x^3+x^6+\cdots)\cdots = \sum x^{m_1 + 2m_2 + 3m_3 + \cdots + km_k},
\]
where the sum is taken over all $k$ and all collections of non-negative integers $m_1, \ldots, m_k$.
When we collect the like terms, the coefficient at $x^n$ will be equal to the number of representations of $n$ in the form
$m_1 + 2m_2 + \cdots + km_k$.
This corresponds to a unique partition, namely to
\[
n = \underbrace{k+\cdots+k}_{m_k} + \cdots + \underbrace{1+\cdots+1}_{m_1}.
\]
Thus the product on the right hand side is equal to the generating function of the number of partitions.
\end{proof}

In the above proof we met an infinite product of power series.
This product is again a power series because in order to compute the coefficient at $x^n$
only finitely many factors from the infinite product are needed (the first $n$ factors in the above case).
Definitions below formalize this.
