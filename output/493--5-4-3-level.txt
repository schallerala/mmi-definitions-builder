Bracket-variable expressions
Assume that we have to multiply three variables , , and .
Here by "multiplication" we mean any binary operation.
If this operation is commutative and associative, then neither the order of variables nor the order of operations is important:

(xy)z = x(yz) = x(zy).

If the operation is associative but not commutative (as multiplication of matrices for example),
then the order of variables matters, but the order of operations does not:

(xy)z = x(yz) x(zy).

Finally, if the operation is neither commutative nor associative (as, for example, ),
then we must take care both of the order of variables and the order of operations:

(xy)z x(yz).

In how many ways can one multiply a given sequence of variables without changing their order?
For two variables there is only one way, for three variables two:  and ,
below are all expressions with four variables:

((x_1x_2)x_3)x_4, (x_1(x_2x_3))x_4, (x_1x_2)(x_3x_4), x_1((x_2x_3)x_4), x_1(x_2(x_3x_4)).
