% The sequence of degrees of all vertices of $G$ is called the degree sequence of $G$:
% \[
% (\deg v_1, \ldots, \deg v_n)
% \]
% Clearly, isomorphic graphs have the same degree sequences.
% The converse is false: $C_6$ and the union of two triangles both have degree sequences $(2,2,2,2,2,2)$,
% but are not isomorphic (one is connected, the other is not).
