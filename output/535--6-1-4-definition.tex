\begin{dfn}
A subset of the set of states $P \subset Q$ is called \emph{$\epsilon$-closed}
if all $\epsilon$-transitions from states of $P$ lead to $P$: for every $q \in P$ one has $\delta(q, \epsilon) \subset P$.

The \emph{$\epsilon$-closure} of a subset $P \subset Q$ is the minimal $\epsilon$-closed subset containing $P$.
We denote the $\epsilon$-closure of $P$ by $\overline{P}$.
