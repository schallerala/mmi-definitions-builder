This result is remarkable for two reasons.
Firstly, the coefficients on the right hand side take only values  and  (and more often  than ).
This means that there is a lot of cancellation happening during this bracket expansion.
Secondly, we know the values of these coefficients exactly.

The proof of the Euler identity is very elegant.
Before learning it, let us see how this identity implies MacMahon's recurrence.

proof[Proof of MacMahon's recurrence]
The formula for generating function of the number of partitions

_n=0^p_n x^n = 1(1-x)(1-x^2)(1-x^3) 

and the Euler identity imply that

(p_0 + p_1 x + p_2 x^2 + )(1 - x - x^2 + x^5 + x^7 - x^12 - x^15 + ) = 1.

The coefficient at , , on the left hand side is

p_n - p_n-1 - p_n-2 + p_n-5 + p_n-7 - ,

while on the right hand side the term  is missing.
This implies the MacMahon recurrence.
proof


The numbers  are called pentagonal numbers
because they count the numbers of dots on Figure fig:PentaNumber.
If one substitutes  for , then  becomes ,
this is why the latter number is also called pentagonal.

What is of importance for us is not the arrangement of dots on Figure fig:PentaNumber
but Ferrers diagrams on Figure fig:FerrersPenta.
They show that pentagonal numbers have partitions of the following form:

3k^2-k2 = k + (k+1) + + (2k-1),

3k^2+k2 = (k+1) + (k+2) + + 2k.

Let us proceed to the proof of Theorem thm:EulerPenta.
Denote by  the number of partitions of  into distinct parts.
Also, denote by  and  the number of partitions of  into an even,
respectively odd number of distinct parts.
