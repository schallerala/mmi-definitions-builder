For $k=0$ the set $U^k$ is a one-element set.
Therefore an interpretation of a nullary function $I(a) \colon U^0 \to U$ is equivalent to choosing an element of $U$.
This is the reason why nullary functions are also called \emph{constants}.
Similarly, an interpretation of a nullary predicate is a choice of a truth value for it.
