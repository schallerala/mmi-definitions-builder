\begin{rem}
One can show that two finite models are elementarily equivalent if and only if the corresponding graphs are isomorphic.
But this is false for infinite models: a doubly infinite path is elementarily equivalent to the union of two of its copies.

The connectivity property of a graph cannot be written as a sentence of the first-order logic.
One can express it with the help of quantifiers over subsets of the universe, which belong already to the second-order logic.
