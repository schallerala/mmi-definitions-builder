\begin{proof}
Receiving $(M, w)$ as input, let $M$ run on $w$.
As soon as $M$ halts accepting $w$, accept the pair $(M,w)$.

A Turing machine which implements the above algorithm can be described in a multi-track architecture:
the first tape holds the code of $M$, the second tape holds the word $w$, the third tape is used to store the state of $M$,
the fourth tape stores the position in the tape of $M$.
\end{proof}
