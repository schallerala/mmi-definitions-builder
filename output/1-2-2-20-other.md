*Proof.* Without loss of generality, let $X = \{1, 2, \ldots, m\}$. In
order to define a map $f \colon X \to Y$ we need to make $m$ choices,
each time from $n$ possibilities: $f(1)$ can take $n$ different values,
so can $f(2)$, and so on up to $f(m)$. Thus there are
$$\underbrace{n \cdots n}_{m} = n^m$$ different maps $X \to Y$. ◻
