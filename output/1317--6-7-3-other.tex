\begin{proof}
We know that CFL's are closed under union.
If they would be closed under complementation, then due to
\[
L_1 \cap L_2 = \overline{\overline{L_1} \cup \overline{L_2}}
\]
they would also be closed under intersection, which is not the case.
\end{proof}

The above argument is non-constructive.
Applied to the languages $L_1$, $L_2$, $L$ from the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:CFLIntClosed} it says that at least one of the following is true:
\begin{enumerate}
\item $L_1$ is context-free, but $\overline{L_1}$ is not;
\item $L_2$ is context-free, but $\overline{L_2}$ is not;
\item $\overline{L_1} \cup \overline{L_2}$ is context free, but its complement is not.
\end{enumerate}
