Given a structure, one can evaluate every closed formula.
For example, the formula  acquires the meaning

x   x+1 1,

which we identify as a true statement.

It should be intuitively clear how to find the truth value of a given closed formula.
But one needs a formal definition.
Of course, it proceeds by recursion because formulas have a recursive structure.
This means that, even if we want to determine the truth values only of closed formulas,
we also need to determine the truth values of formulas with free variables (which appear as intermediate steps when building a closed formula).

A variable assignment is a map  which associated to every variable an element from the universe.
Together with interpretation  it allows to evaluate every term to an element of  and every formula to a truth value.

Given terms  which evaluate to  and a -ary function symbol ,
the term  evaluates to .
Similarly, a formula  evaluates to  if  evaluates to .
Given terms  and  which evaluate to  and , the formula  evaluates to true if and only if .
Formulas of the form , , ,  evaluate according to the truth tables
for logical connectives.
A formula  evaluates to true if there exists an evaluation  that differs from  only in the value of 
such that  evaluates under  to true.
A formula  evaluates to true if  evaluates to true under all assignments  that differ from  only in the value of .

One sees that the truth values of  and  do not depend on the assignment value of the variable .
It follows that the truth values of closed formulas are independent of the variable assignments, hence determined by  only.
