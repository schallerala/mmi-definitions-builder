proof[First proof]
A regular language can be constructed from the basic languages , , 
by operations of union, concatenation and Kleene closure.
Therefore it suffices to show that the basic languages are context-free.
Each of them is generated by the grammars with a single variable  and the following production sets:

P =  for L = , P = S   for L = , P = S a  for L = a.

proof

proof[Second proof]
A regular language is accepted by some DFA.
Every DFA can be viewed as a PDA with stack playing no role and word acceptance by final states.
