The last condition can be replaced by the requirement that  is the smallest (in the sense of inclusion) set satisfying the first three conditions.

A propositional formula has a recursive structure that can be represented with a parse tree.
See Figure fig:ParseTreeProp for an example.

figure[ht]
center

center
Parse tree for .
fig:ParseTreeProp
figure

Parentheses in a propositional formula ensure that the parse tree is unique.
If the root of the parsing tree is labeled with , or , then the formula starts with  and ends with .
This pair of parentheses is not needed for parsing, and we will often omit it.
Strictly speaking, this is syntactically wrong, but should not lead to confusion.
