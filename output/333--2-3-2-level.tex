\subsection{Euler's formula}
A plane graph separates the plane into regions, called \emph{faces}.
Every embedding has one unbounded face, called the \emph{outer face}.

The graphs on Figure \ref{fig:TwoEmbeddings} have two faces each.
If the graph has $n$ vertices and no edges, then its embedding has only one face: the plane punctured at $n$ points.

A face is called incident with an edge if the edge belongs to the boundary of the face.
