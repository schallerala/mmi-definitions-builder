\begin{exl}
A person wants to go to a swimming pool once a week, and play tennis once a week, but not both on the same day.
How many different schedules are there?

Choose a swimming day. There are $7$ possibilities for this.
When the choice is made, there remain $6$ possible tennis days.
So, there are $7 \cdot 6 = 42$ different schedules.
