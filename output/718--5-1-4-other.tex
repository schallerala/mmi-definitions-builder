\subsection{The case of complex roots}
Back to the case of a recursive sequence of order 2, what happens if the characteristic polynomial
\[
x^2 - rx - s
\]
has no real roots? This happens when the discriminant $D = r^2 + 4s$ is negative.
Then it has two complex roots
\[
\lambda_{1,2} = \frac{r \pm \sqrt{D}}2,
\]
and all arguments remain valid: the geometric progressions $\lambda_i^n$ solve the recurrence and every sequence satisfying the recurrence
can be written as a linear combination of these two progressions.

The two complex roots are conjugate to each other:
\[
\lambda_1 = \lambda, \quad \lambda_2 = \overline{\lambda}.
\]
A linear combination of the progressions $\lambda^n$ and $\overline{\lambda}^n$ takes real values only if the coefficients are conjugate:
\[
a_n = c \lambda^n + \overline{c} \overline{\lambda}^n.
\]

Let us write the roots in the exponential form:
\[
\lambda = \rho e^{i\phi} = \rho (\cos\phi + i \sin\phi), \quad \overline{\lambda} = \rho e^{-i\phi} = \rho (\cos\phi - i\sin\phi).
\]
Then we have
\begin{multline*}
c \lambda^n + \overline{c} \overline{\lambda}^n
= \rho^n(ce^{in\phi} + \overline{c}e^{-in\phi})\\
= \rho^n(c(\cos n\phi + i\sin n\phi) + \overline{c}(\cos n\phi - i\sin n\phi))\\
= \rho^n((c+\overline{c}) \cos n\phi + i(c-\overline{c}) \sin n\phi)
\end{multline*}
That is, every recursive sequence is a linear combination with real coefficients of the following two sequences:
\[
\rho^n \cos n\phi \quad \text{and} \quad \rho^n \sin n\phi.
\]

Consider the special case $\rho = 1$.
Then the recursive relation has the form
\[
a_n = r a_{n-1} - a_{n-2},
\]
where $r = 2 \cos\phi$.
If $\phi$ is a rational multiple of $\pi$, then this sequence will be periodic independently of the initial values $a_0, a_1$.
For example, this is the case of the recurrence
\[
a_n = a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}
\]
Here $\phi = \frac{\pi}{3}$, and the sequence will have period $6$.
(This is also easy to check by iterating the recurrence relation and writing $a_2, a_3, \ldots$ in terms of $a_0$ and $a_1$.)
If $\phi$ is not a rational multiple of $\pi$, then the sequence will not be periodic.
It will fill densely some interval.
This is the case of the recurrence
\[
a_n = \frac{a_{n-1}}2 - a_{n-2}.
\]
