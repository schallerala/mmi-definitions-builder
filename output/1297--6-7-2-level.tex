\subsection{The pumping lemma for CFLs}
For any finite alphabet $\Sigma$ the set of all words $\Sigma^*$ is countably infinite.
The set of all languages over $\Sigma$ is the set of all subsets of $\Sigma^*$ and therefore uncountably infinite.
On the other hand, the set of all pushdown automata with the input language $\Sigma$ is countably infinite
(as is the set of all context-free grammars).
It follows that there are languages which are not context-free.

The following theorem provides a tool to prove non-context-freeness of some languages.
