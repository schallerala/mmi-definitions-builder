proof
One has

1(1-x)^k = (1+x+x^2+)(1+x+x^2+)_k

When one expands the brackets in the product on the right hand side,
one picks from the first brackets a monomial , from the second  and so on up to  from the last brackets.
The product of these monomials is .
When one collects the monomials of degree , one obtains a term ,
where  is the number of solutions of the equation

m_1 + + m_k = n,

where the unknowns  can take only non-negative integer values.
The number of solutions is exactly the number of weak compositions of  from  parts.
proof

Now, by applying the generalized binomial theorem one obtains

_n=0^a_n x^n = 1(1-x)^k = (1-x)^-k = _n=0^(-1)^n -kn x^n

Thus we have

a_n = (-1)^n -kn = n+k-1n = n+k-1k-1.
