A graph that has at least one perfect matching is called matchable.
A matchable graph must have an even number of vertices.
(More generally, every connected component of a matchable graph must have an even number of vertices.)
But there are also connected unmatchable graphs with an even number of vertices, see Figure fig:PerfMatch, right.

Two connected graphs on six vertices: one matchable (matching is shown by thick edges) and one non-matchable.

If it is not possible to match all vertices, then one can ask for a maximum possible matching.
There are two notions of maximality.
