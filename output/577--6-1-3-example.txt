Let us construct a DFA equivalent to the NFA in Figure fig:NFA.
For convenience, write first the table of our NFA.
center
tabularccc
 &  & 

 &  & 

 &  & 

 &  & 
tabular
center
The set  has  subsets, so if we follow the construction given in the theorem literally, we must write a table with  rows.
However, not all of the  states will be accessible from the initial state.
The inaccessible states can be removed from the automaton without affecting the language.
Therefore we will introduce new rows in our table for  only as soon as they are needed.
Also, for a better distinction we will use in  the  brackets instead of the set brackets .
The result is the following table:
center
tabularccc
 &  & 

 &  & 

 &  & 

 &  & 

 &  & 
tabular
center
For brevity, rename the states so that the table takes the form
center
tabularccc
 &  & 

 &  & 

 &  & 

 &  & 

 &  & 
tabular
center
The corresponding transition diagram is shown in Figure fig:NFAtoDFA.
The final states are  and  because they correspond to the sets which contain the final state  of .
