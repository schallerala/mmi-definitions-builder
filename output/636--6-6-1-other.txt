There are two versions of acceptance criteria.
In the first, a word  is accepted if some sequence of moves corresponding to the input  leads to an empty stack
(which means that the start symbol  on the bottom of the stack should also be removed).
In this case the set of final states is irrelevant, one may put .

In the second version, a word  is accepted if some sequence of moves corresponding to the input  brings the automaton to a final state.

A PDA is deterministic if every set  contains at most one element
(from every state and every input symbol at most one move is possible, taking -transitions into account).
Note however that  means that in the state  with top stack symbol 
the input symbol  is rejected (or "breaks" the automaton).
