Without -productions it is impossible to produce the empty word,
so we cannot get rid of them if the language contains .
On the other hand, if a grammar contains -productions,
this does not necessarily mean that the generated language contains .

Unit productions can be helpful, they introduce sort of "branching". For example, the grammar

S A B, A AA 0, B BB 1

is a simple grammar generating the language .
