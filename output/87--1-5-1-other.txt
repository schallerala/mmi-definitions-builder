proof
We will show that every element of the union is counted exactly once on the right hand side of the formula.

(Can make a warm-up for the elements in the intersection of all sets.)
Take an element that belongs to exactly  of the sets .
In the first sum on the right hand side it is counted  times,
in the second sum  times, and so on.
In total, this element is counted with the multiplicity

k1 - k2 + + (-1)^k-1kk.

Due to Theorem thm:BinAltern, this sum is equal to .
