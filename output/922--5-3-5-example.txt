Turning a partition with odd parts into a partition with distinct parts:

42 = 7+7+7+3+ +3_7 = 7 (2+1) + 3(4+2+1) = 14 + 7 + 12 + 6 + 3 = 14 + 12 + 7 + 6 + 3

Turning a partition with distinct parts into a partition with odd parts:

42 = 20 + 12 + 10 = 45 + 4 3 + 2 5 = (4+2)5 + 43 = 5++5_6 + 3 + 3 + 3
