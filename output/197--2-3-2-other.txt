Induction on the number of edges.

Let . The only connected graph without edges is the graph with one vertex.
It has one face, and we have . The induction base is proved.

Now take a graph with  edges, .
Consider two cases.

1) The graph is acyclic.
Then it is a tree. A tree does not separate the plane, so we have  in this case.
By Theorem thm:TreeEdges, .
Thus we have

V - E + F = V - (V-1) + 1 = 2.


2) The graph contains a cycle.
Let  be any cycle and let  be any edge of .
The graph  is still connected and has one edge less.
Let us show that it also has one face less.
Indeed, the points on different sides of  belong to different faces of :
any arc connecting them must intersect the cycle .
These two faces are merged to one face in ; all other faces are unchanged.
Thus  has the same number of vertices, one edge less, and one face less than .
By the induction assumption, Euler's formula holds for .
Thus it also holds for .
