Speaking more formally, any valuation  extends to a unique map

v 0,1

defined recursively by  for all  and by
align*
v(A B) &= v(A) v(B) & v(A B) &= v(A) v(B)

v(A B) &= v(A) v(B) & v(A) &= v(A),
align*
where the values at the right hand sides are computed according to the truth tables of logical connectives.

Although by definition every valuation  assigns truth values to all proposition symbols,
in order to determine  we need to know only the values of symbols occuring in .
