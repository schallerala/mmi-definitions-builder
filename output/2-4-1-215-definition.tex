\begin{dfn}
Let $G = (V, E)$ be a graph.
A set of its edges $M \subset E$ is called a \emph{matching} if no two edges in $M$ have a common vertex.
If a vertex $v$ belongs to an edge of $M$, then $v$ is called \emph{matched}, otherwise \emph{unmatched}.
A matching is called \emph{perfect} if all vertices of $G$ are matched.
\end{dfn}
