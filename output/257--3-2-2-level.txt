A Hilbert system
A Hilbert-style deductive system has a single inference rule, the so-called modus ponens:

A, A B B

(If  is provable and  is provable, then  is provable.)
We will abbreviate modus ponens by MP.

There are many different axyom systems.
Here is one of them, the third ukasiewicz' system.

&A (B A)

&(A (B C)) ((A B) (A C))

&(A B) (B A)

Here , , and  may be any propositional formulas.
Thus, in fact, we have infinitely many axioms (axiom instances) that can be obtained from the above axiom schemata
by substituting for , , and  some particular formulas.
