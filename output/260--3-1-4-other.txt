proof
By Theorem thm:BooleNF every Boolean function can be represented by a formula using  only.
Replace every occurrence of  using a De Morgan law and the double negation:

A B (A B).

This gives an equivalent formula with connectives  and  only.
One removes conjunctions in a similar way with the help of the equivalence

A B (A B).

proof

For example,
align*
(p q) (p q) &((p q) (p q))

&(p q) (p q)
align*

One can achieve an absolute minimalism by introducing a logical connective  with the truth table
center
tabularccccc

(also called  for obvious reasons).
