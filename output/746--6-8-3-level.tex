\subsection{Problems and languages}
Consider a problem like ``Is a given finite graph connected?''
An \emph{instance} of a problem is any finite graph.
Since graphs can be encoded as words in an alphabet, this problem determines a language:
the set of all words encoding connected graphs.
This holds for any question which depends on some countable parameter and has a yes/no answer:
encode the parameter values by words, and consider the set of all words for which the answer to the question is ``yes''.
