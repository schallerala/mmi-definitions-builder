Construct an automaton accepting the language .

The automaton obtained with the above argument has ten states, see Example 2.12 from the first edition of Hopcroft-Ullman.
One can rather easily construct an -NFA with three states.
The above algorithm aims not for the smallest number of states, but for the simplicity of the construction.
