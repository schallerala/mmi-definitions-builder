\begin{dfn}
\emph{Formulas} are expressions that can be obtained by finitely many applications of the following rules.
\begin{itemize}
\item
If $P$ is a $k$-ary predicate symbol, and $t_1, \ldots, t_k$ are terms, then $P(t_1, \ldots, t_k)$ is a formula.
\item
If $t_1$ and $t_2$ are terms, then $t_1 = t_2$ is a formula.
\item
If $\phi$ is a formula, then so is $\neg \phi$.
\item
If $\phi$ and $\psi$ are formulas, then so are $\phi \wedge \psi$, $\phi \vee \psi$, $\phi \to \psi$.
\item
If $\phi$ is a formula, and $x$ is a variable, then $\forall x \phi$ and $\exists x \phi$ are formulas.
\end{itemize}
