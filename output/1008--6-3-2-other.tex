\begin{proof}
1) The path corresponding to the shortest accepted word does not visit any state more than once.
Otherwise it contains a cycle, and by removing this cycle we obtain a shorter accepted word.
Therefore the length of the shortest accepted word is strictly less than $n$.

2) \emph{The ``if'' direction.} If $z$ is an accepted word of length $\ge n$, then its path contains a cycle.
By pumping this cycle, we obtain infinitely many accepted words.

\emph{The ``only if'' direction.} If the language is infinite, then it contains a word $z$ with $|z| \ge n$.
If $|z| < 2n$, then we are done.
If $|z| \ge 2n$, then write $z$ as $z = uvw$ according to the pumping lemma.
Then $uw$ is also accepted, and we have $|uw| = |z| - |v| \ge |z| - n \ge n$.
Thus we can apply the same case distiction to the word $uw$ and proceed until we get a word of length $\ge n$ and $< 2n$.
