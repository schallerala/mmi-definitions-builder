Euler's totient function
Two positive integers whose greatest common divisor equals  are called relatively prime.
Denote by  the number of positive integers  which are relatively prime to :

(n) = k 1, 2, , n (k,n) = 1.

For example, for  only the numbers  and  among  are relatively prime to ,
so that we have .
In  is prime, then all numbers  are relatively prime to , so that .
