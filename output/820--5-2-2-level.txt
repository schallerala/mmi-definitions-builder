Operations with formal power series
sec:OperFPS
There are two ways of interpreting the calculations we made above.
The first approach is by viewing  as a real number close to  such that the power series  converges.
Then some theorems from calculus ensure that all our operations were correct.
The second approach is to deal with  as a formal expression,
to define operations with such expressions, and to show that these operations satisfy all of the usual algebraic properties.
We choose the second approach: formal power series.
