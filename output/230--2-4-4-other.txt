proof
Let  be a -regular bipartite graph.
Since every edge is incident to exactly one vertex from , and every vertex is incident to exactly  edges, we have .
Similarly, . Thus we have .

Let us show that -regularity implies condition eqn:Hall.
Take any  and consider the bipartite graph , where  is the set of all edges incident to a vertex from .
By the above argument, .
On the other hand, for every  we have , which implies .
It follows that

N(S) E'k = S,

and we are done.
