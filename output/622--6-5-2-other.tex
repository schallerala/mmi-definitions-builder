Without $\epsilon$-productions it is impossible to produce the empty word,
so we cannot get rid of them if the language contains $\epsilon$.
On the other hand, if a grammar contains $\epsilon$-productions,
this does not necessarily mean that the generated language contains $\epsilon$.

Unit productions can be helpful, they introduce sort of ``branching''. For example, the grammar
\[
S \to A \mid B, \quad A \to AA \mid 0, \quad B \to BB \mid 1
\]
is a simple grammar generating the language $(0^* \cup 1^*) \setminus \{\epsilon\}$.
