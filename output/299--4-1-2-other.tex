One can rectify any formula by renaming the variables as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item
For every quantifier in the formula determine its ``scope''.
For this, look at the recursive structure of the formula,
namely at the step when the quantifier appeared: $\phi \rightsquigarrow \forall x \phi$.
The subformula $\phi$ is the scope of $\forall x$.
\item
If the variable $x$ bound by a quantifier occurs not only inside the scope,
but also outside, then replace all occurrences of $x$ inside the scope and under the quantifier by some completely new symbol.
\end{itemize}

The resulting formula is semantically equivalent to the original one (although we have not yet described the semantics).
