\begin{thm}
Let $A$ be a proposition.
Take a closed deduction tree with $\vdash A$ at the root.
For each counterexample leaf $p_1, \ldots, p_k \vdash q_1, \ldots, q_l$ of this tree write a disjunctive clause
\[
\neg p_1 \vee \cdots \vee \neg p_k \vee q_1 \vee \cdots \vee q_l.
\]
Then the conjunction of all such clauses is a CNF for $A$.
