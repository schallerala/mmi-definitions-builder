\begin{dfn}
A \emph{nondeterministic finite automaton (NFA)} is a quintuple $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, q_0, F)$, where as before
$Q$ is a set of states, $\Sigma$ is a finite alphabet, $q_0 \in Q$ is the initial state, $F \subset Q$ is the set of final states.
However, the transition function
\[
\delta \colon Q \times \Sigma \to 2^Q
\]
associates to a pair $(q,a)$ not a state, but a set of states $P \subset Q$, which is allowed to be empty.
