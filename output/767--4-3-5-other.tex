\begin{proof}
By the lemma, the set $\Th(T)$ is recursively enumerable, so that it remains to show that its complement is recursively enumerable.
But in a complete theory, $T \not\vdash A$ if and only if $T \vdash \neg A$.
Thus, if we use $\neg A$ as an input for the algorithm which stops if and only if its input is a theorem, then this algorithm will stop if and only if
$A$ is not a theorem.
\end{proof}
