A minor of a graph  is any graph obtained by repeated vertex deletions, edge deletions and edge contractions.
See Figure fig:K5Contraction for an example of an edge contraction.
If an edge contraction results in a multiple edge, then we replace a multiple edge by a simple edge.
If it results in a loop, then we remove a loop.

Note that a minor of  is not necessarily isomorphic to a subgraph of .
For example, the cycle  is a minor of  but not its subgraph.

Similarly to the Kuratowski theorem, one direction of the Wagner theorem is easy to prove, but not the other.
