Let us construct a DFA equivalent to the -NFA from Example exl:ENFA.

The transition table is obtained by consulting the table from Example exl:ENFA
and applying the rule .
As in the construction of an NFA out of a DFA, it might be not necessary to consider all subsets of .
We start with the row corresponding to the initial state,
and add a new row for every state which appeared in one of the previous rows.
The construction ends when no new states appear.

The initial state in our case is .
