The matrix  has zero determinant (because the vector  belongs to its kernel).
Moreover, its rank equals , where  and  is the number of connected components of .
In particular, if  is connected, then  contains an  minor with non-zero determinant.
In fact,  implies that all cofactors  are equal (you can try to prove this).
This common value is the number of the spanning trees.
