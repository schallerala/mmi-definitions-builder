\begin{proof}
There is a bijection between $n$-multisets and weak compositions of $n$ from $k$ parts.
Namely, to a weak composition $n = x_1 + \cdots + x_k$ of $n$ we associate the multiset
where $1$ occurs $x_1$ times, $2$ occurs $x_2$ times etc.
The number of weak compositions was computed in Theorem \ref{thm:WeakComp}.
\end{proof}
