The pumping lemma
Let  be a finite alphabet.
The set  of all words in  is countably infinite.
The set  of all languages in  is uncountable: it has the cardinality of the continuum.
On the other hand, the set of regular languages is countable, because the set of all regular expressions (and of all finite automata) is countable.
(Note that different automata or different regular expressions can define the same language, but this is not a problem.)
It follows that "most" languages are non-regular.

The above argument is a pure existence proof.
In this section we prove the pumping lemma, a tool that allows to prove the non-regularity of some languages.

Before stating the lemma, let us explain the underlying idea.
Let  be a DFA.
Any word  accepted by  determines a path from the initial state  to one of the finals states .
If the word  is long enough (namely if its length is bigger than the number of states of ),
then the corresponding path contains a cycle.
This cycle gives rize to infinitely many other words accepted by , because one can run along it several times.
For example, in Figure fig:LongWord one has .
By repeating or removing the cycle contained in the path, one obtains

a_1a_2(a_3a_4a_5)^ka_6a_7 L(M)

for all , including .

The existence of a cycle can be stated as follows.
