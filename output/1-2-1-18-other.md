A map is bijective iff at every element of $Y$ ends exactly one arrow.
By inverting the arrows we obtain the *inverse map*
$f^{-1} \colon Y \to X$, which has the properties $f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$ for
all $x \in X$ and $f(f^{-1}(y)) = y$ for all $y \in Y$.

If $f$ is not bijective, then there is no inverse map $f^{-1}$. However,
by abuse of notation one uses $f^{-1}(y)$ to denote the *preimage* of
$y$: $$f^{-1}(y) = \{x \in X \mid f(x) = y\}.$$ Similarly one can define
the preimage $f^{-1}(B)$ of any subset $B \subset Y$.

Observe that

-   $f$ injective $\Leftrightarrow$ $|f^{-1}(y)| \le 1$ for all $y$;

-   $f$ surjective $\Leftrightarrow$ $f^{-1}(y) \ne \varnothing$ for all
    $y$.

We can now formulate the quotient rule in the mathematical language.

*If a map $f \colon X \to Y$ satisfies $|f^{-1}(y)| = k$ for all
$y \in Y$, then $|Y| = \frac{|X|}{k}$.*

A special case of this is the bijection principle:

*If a map $f \colon X \to Y$ is a bijection, then $|X| = |Y|$.*
