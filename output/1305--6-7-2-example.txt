The language  is not context-free.
Assume it is, and let  be a pumping bound for this language.
Take the word  and write it as  according to the pumping lemma.
By the lemma, the word  is in , we will however show that this is impossible.

The subword  is contained within some two consecutive blocks (inside  or ).






If  is contained in the first half, then while transforming  to  we removed some symbols from the first half.
It follows that , where  and at least one of them is .
This word does not belong to .
Similarly, for the other situations of  the depumped word has the form  or  and does not belong to  either.
