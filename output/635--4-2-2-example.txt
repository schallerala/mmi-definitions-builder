Let us prove the formula .

At the second step we are introducing a new variable  while applying the left  inference rule.
After application of the branching left  rule we obtain an axiom on the left (with  on both sides of ).
On the right we are applying the right  rule, where we can make a clever choice of a term to substitute for .
Choosing  as the substitution, we obtain two equal terms on both sides of , and the proof tree is finished.
